## ⏪ Recap of Last Session
The Dwarven King of [[Val Taruum]] tasked you with a critical mission: to enter the volatile rift above the city’s failing Clockwork Heart and seal the portal from the other side. This instability seemed to be in part connected to [[The Deceiver – Phenax]], the God of Deception & Thieves, as evidenced by his appearance and that of his violet energy.

You ventured through the chaotic rift and found yourselves in **Mechanus**, the clockwork plane of absolute order, but it was corrupted. Chaotic energies had twisted the logic of **Primus**, the plane’s ruler, who was stuck in an insane error state. Primus now believed it must 'perfect' the Material Plane by imposing 'lawful chaos' and was preparing a massive modron invasion force, using the [[Val Taruum]] rift as its beachhead.

Your ultimate goal was to stop this invasion and save [[Val Taruum]] by closing the anchor point for the rift -- The Conduit Core

Your journey through Mechanus unfolded in four main parts:
1. **Passage to Mechanus:** You immediately faced modron patrols and high-alert status after arriving at a planar docking platform, your entry point having been anything but clean.
   
2. **Journey to the Conduit Core:** You traversed a dangerous landscape, overcoming challenges like the Resonance Brigade and the Lever Bridge. 
   
3. **Nexus Guardian Ascent:** You fought a formidable, multi-echelon modron defense—including a high-ranking Octon—as you ascended the colossal, spiraling gear-platform of the Conduit Core.
   
4. **Confronting Primus & Sealing the Rift:** You reached the Synchronization Chamber and engaged with the corrupted Primus, learning the extent of its madness and glimpsing the subtle influence of chaos' deceptive hand. In the final moments, **Everywhere** was given a great gift, connected to the lawful light of [[The Bright Father – Heliod]], God of the Sun & Laws, to override the chaotic taint. This immense act of power sealed the rift with pure, ordered energy, prevented the wider invasion.

The exhaustion of your journey, the mind-bending logic of Mechanus, and the sheer power required to seal the rift have finally caught up with you. You have returned to a grateful [[Val Taruum]], the Clockwork Heart restored and stable, for now. But the cost was immense.

Your successful intervention saved [[Val Taruum]] from an immediate invasion, but your triumph sent ripples across the planes. Primus is no longer corrupted, casting a shadow of could have happened over Mechanus itself. More critically, you provided [[The Deceiver – Phenax]] with exactly what he wanted, what that is is still clouded in mystery to you but He  truly knows your power now. You sealed the rift, but in doing so, you merely diverted his attention.

Everywhere's powerful new weapon, seemingly sent by the gods themselves, that was used to help seal the rift could mean a great many things. Is she now a conduit, a weapon, a key? Another play thing of the gods?

So now the questions are: What is The Deciever's next move, and how will he use the knowledge he gained from you against the rest of the world? What new threats could be cresting over the horizon? And why was Everywhere given such a gift?

## 🎯 Next Steps & Goals (Pre-Game Prep)

### 1. The Strong Start
#### **Scene: The Audience with King Grimbeard Stonebrow**

**Setting:** The Val Taruum Royal Audience Hall. The King is seated, looking exhausted but deeply relieved. The room is packed with the court, advisors, and royal guards. The steady, powerful _thrum_ of the stabilized Clockwork Heart is palpable.

#### **King Grimbeard Stonebrow's Opening Speech**

The King rises slowly, his movements heavy but commanding, and regards the party with a look of profound relief.

> "Silence! The adventurers who dared to venture into the maelstrom stand before us. I confess, there were days I thought this city would collapse into chaos, swallowed by the violet storms that choked our skies. The great **Clockwork Heart** of Val Taruum was a mad, desperate drumbeat—a sign of the encroaching end."
> 
> "But now... the heart beats pure and true. The air is clean, and the violet madness is gone. You faced whatever cosmic horror plagued us, and you succeeded. The city is safe."
> 
> **"You saved Val Taruum. Now, tell me, heroes: What devilry did you face in the deep, and what impossible act did you perform to cleanse the Heart of Val Taruum?"**

#### **The King's Inquiries**

Once the party has given their initial account of the mission, King Grimbeard would shift from gruff gratitude to pragmatic concern, seeking to understand the full scope of the danger.

These questions are designed to extract the major plot points (The Primus corruption, Phenax's involvement, and the Divine Seeds) that the King needs to know for the next arc:

1. **On the Nature of the Threat:**
    
    > "You say this was no mere elemental chaos, but a breach into the mechanical plane of **Mechanus**? You mean to tell me a god, **Primus**, ruler of that plane, was the _source_ of the chaos? What could possibly corrupt a being of pure law and order?"
    
2. **On the True Mastermind:**
    
    > "A shadowy influence—a 'Returned God of Deceit' named **Phenax**? Is this fiend working to gather power from planar tears? Is he truly using our city’s Clockwork Heart as a key to his mad ambition? I want names, places, and methods. How close did he come to his goal?"
    
3. **On the Fix and the Cost:**
    
    > "The final act that stabilized the Heart—the surge of pure energy you unleashed. You used the power of the **Divine Seeds** you carry, did you not? What was the true nature of the device you implemented, and does this success come with a cost? Does this 'Phenax' now know you carry what he seeks?"
    
4. **On the Global Implications:**
    
    > "If this villain's goal is to target and perhaps dethrone the sun god **Heliod**, then this threat extends far beyond Val Taruum. What knowledge did you gain that can help us warn the other great kingdoms? Where do we look next for signs of this Phenax's hand?"
