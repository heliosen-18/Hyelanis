## ⏪ Recap of Last Session
### **The Departure from Val Taruum**

The session began with the party tying up loose ends in the city before their long journey north.
- **Harvin’s Preparations**: Harvin coordinated the delivery of bags containing skeletons and a sending stone to the ship.
- **The Altar of Heliod**: Everywhere moved forward with his goal of honoring the Bright Father. He paid Norwan Valedale 52 GP to begin construction of an altar at the end of Pier 7A in the Merchant Mile. A special "anchor brick" engraved with the ship's name was laid in the foundation.
- **Royal Support**: King Grimbeard delivered the promised monthly stipend of 5 tons of Powdered Sordalite Fuel and assigned Foreman Doydown to begin building barracks on the pier.
- **The Ancient Smith**: While visiting the obsidian hut of the Ancient Smith to discuss the repair of the Moss Wall, the smith provided a cryptic warning: the King must be reminded that repairs require entry into the "world break" and a price must be paid.
### **Shadows and Bargains**

A significant portion of the session involved a tense negotiation with **Lady Ebonshade** and the Shadowed Covenant.
- **The Meeting**: The party traveled to the "Nexus of Whispers," a clandestine base hidden within the structural tunnels of the Unification Bridge's Low Ward.
- **The Deal**: Lady Ebonshade offered intelligence on the Night Lord (Raunaeril Xistrith) and an **Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location** to shield Estrid from her father’s senses. In exchange, she demanded a vial of Estrid’s blood.
- **The Outcome**: Estrid initially refused the deal. However, as an act of "good faith," Lady Ebonshade left the magical amulet under Harvin’s pillow.
### **Arrival at Sunware Key**

The party boarded the _Twilight Drift_ for a 40-hour flight to the northern reaches.

- **The Landscape**: Upon arrival, they found Sunware Key to be a 50-mile island dominated by an active volcano. The geothermal activity creates a strangely warm "paradise" amidst the freezing northern seas.
- **Key Landing**: They observed the village of Key Landing, a settlement of 900 souls with a harbor disproportionately large for its size, filled with trading and naval vessels.
- **The Fortress**: Off the coast, they spotted a small stone fortress with a bell tower and gardens, nestled between three stony peaks on a rugged islet known as Firewatch Island.
- **The Harpies**: Upon arriving to Sunware Key the crew went to the town of Uskarn. At the Fog and Frog the party heard a commotion from the outside. They were then vicisously attacked and sung to by harpies before killing them all and saving Alister from following one to his doom.

### **Unresolved Threads**

- **The Sword**: The party’s custom sword is expected to be finished in one week.
- **The Quest for Essence**: Everywhere learned that the price of a magic ring could be significantly dropped (from 4000 GP) if he provides the bottled essence of an incorporeal creature.
- **The Next Move**: The party must now decide whether to follow the pirate's map toward the wreck of the _Tammeraut_ or any other affairs on Sunware Key.
- **Estrid's Love Life**: What was Estrid doing with Xander when Harvin went to deliver the amulet to her?

## 📝 Live Session Log
*Use this section during the session for quick notes.*

#### **In-Game Time: Session Start**
 - Everywhere plucks harpy feathers. 20 feathers collected. 
	 - **Potion of Feather Fall:** The most common use. The natural buoyancy of the feather helps "lighten" the imbiber.
    - **Potion of Levitation / Fly:** Used as a stabilizer to keep the drinker aloft.
    - **Potion of Swiftness:** Harpies are incredibly fast divers; their feathers can be distilled into elixirs that increase movement speed.
    - **Storm-in-a-Bottle:** In some homebrew rules, feathers from a harpy killed during a thunderstorm can be used to create items that cast _Gust of Wind_ or _Fog Cloud_.
- Harvin looks for:
	- vampire blood  
	- beholder eye
	- nightshade berries
- Ended a day.
- 4 handles (empty rum bottles collected)
- Harvin barricades outside kitchen door with table
- 20 rations, expire after 7 days from larder and delivery supplies
