## ⏪ Recap of Last Session
**The Stargazer’s Flood & The Pirate’s Map**

**The Calm Before the Storm** We picked up shortly after your elevation to "Heroes of Val Taruum." You had secured your rewards—including 5 tons of fuel monthly and access to the Ancient Forge—and struck a secret, revolutionary accord with Councilor Willow Whisperwind to assassinate the "Night Lord."

**The Breach at the Eye** While the city slept, Harvin remained at the _Stargazer's Eye_, peering through the planar lens. He found what he was looking for—a vision of his family trapped within a bubble, protected by a Dragon Turtle. But the gaze went both ways.

The telescope shuddered and failed, bursting open to unleash a torrent of freezing, deep-ocean brine. From the high-pressure spray, a "Shade of Water"—an echo of the very Dragon Turtle protecting Harvin’s kin—manifested along with water weirds, flooding the observatory.

**Aftermath & Revelations** After defeating the elemental threat, the party regrouped.

- **Harvin’s Fury:** Harvin revealed the vision of his family to the group. In a moment of vulnerability and rage, he condemned the goddess Thassa, declaring that she has forsaken her followers and stolen his family solely for power—a conclusion drawn from his grief.
- **Damage Control:** Realizing the _Stargazer's Eye_ was wrecked, Harvin penned a careful letter to King Grimbeard, notifying him of the "malfunction" while diplomatically avoiding direct blame.
- **The Queen’s Curse:** Amidst the chaos, Harvin also began researching hexes and curses, seeking a way to aid the Queen with her necromantic affliction.

**The Path Forward** The session concluded with Rylan finally cracking the code of the treasure map. He linked it to the wreck of the _Tammeraut_, a war galley captained by the pirate sorcerer Syrgaul, located near **[[Sunware Key]]**.

With a departure date set for the **18th**, you prepared to leave the city, armed with a new Scroll of Waterbreathing and a heading toward buried secrets.

#### **Scene 1: Lady Ebonshade**

The Covenant's base is hidden within a structural tunnel system beneath the Low Ward, the bottom-most level of the Unification Bridge. This placement leverages the level's more basic accommodations and workshops to camouflage its clandestine operations.

##### **The Entrance: The Forgotten Vent**

As characters approach the target location in the Low Ward:

- **Exterior Appearance:** The tunnel entrance is not a door, but a massive, rusted, and permanently sealed ventilation shaft grille set into the stone structure below one of the rough-hewn workshops. The stone around it is dark with grime and weeping with condensation from the bay below, and the air here is thick with the smells of damp stone, machine oil, and the fainter metallic scent from the nearby dwarven districts.
- **Camouflage:** The large grille is heavily marked with symbols in chalk and scorch marks—the residue of failed, abandoned **gnomish contraptions** or an old, non-functional **alchemical device**. This makes the opening look like a long-forgotten piece of industrial equipment, ignored by the workers and residents of the Low Ward.
- **The Activation:** The only way to open the grille is by performing a precise, silent ritual. If Lady Ebonshade or one of her agents were expecting the characters, a ripple of shadow magic—a momentary black spot deeper than any physical shadow—would pulse on the rusted metal. The grille would then silently _shift_, not swinging open, but seemingly dissolving into a shimmering, light-bending illusion, revealing a dark, tight passage beyond.

##### **The Interior: The Nexus of Whispers**

Beyond the illusion, the base is a blend of rough-hewn structural architecture and refined dark magic, perfectly suited for the Covenant’s activities of **Shadow Infiltration** and **Dark Bargains**.

1. **The Entry Tunnel (The "Veil"):**
    - **Architecture:** The passage is a narrow, claustrophobic maintenance tunnel, its stone walls slick with moisture and crisscrossed by thick, insulated pipes.
    - **The Ward:** A palpable, cold magical energy presses against the skin. This area is constantly saturated with shadow magic to **confuse and disorient** unwelcome intruders, making the space seem to shift and double back on itself (an applied gnomish illusion technique, but twisted with the Covenant's dark arts).
2. **The Hub (The Gathering Point):**
    - **Atmosphere:** The tunnel widens into a natural cavern or large structural chamber. The space is illuminated only by a few carefully controlled sources: faint, greenish-blue phosphorescent moss and the pale, cold light from a cluster of **cursed artifacts** contained behind wrought-iron grates.
    - **Lady Ebonshade's Presence:** This is where the **Mistress of Whispers** conducts her business. She would be seated near the center, her long, raven-black hair seeming to **meld with the shadows around her**.
    - **Acoustics:** Despite being so close to the bridge's support structure, the room is eerily quiet. The sound of the thrumming bridge above is almost completely muted by powerful, magical sound-dampening wards, ensuring that the **secrets extracted from the most guarded minds** are never heard by the outside world.

##### **The Discussions**

Phase 1: Establishing Mutual Gain and Acknowledging the Target

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**Acknowledge the Mission:** She would immediately confirm she knows _why_ Estrid is there, using the organization's reputation for **espionage**.|_Focus on Raunaeril:_ "The Night Lord is a slippery shadow, even for us. Your desire for **vengeance** is noted, but he does not fall to common steel."|Estrid is **paranoid** and **hates shapeshifters**. She would be terse, demanding proof of the Covenant's resources and capability to deal with a powerful entity like her father, the **originator of vampires**.|
|**Praise the Weapon:** She would display knowledge of Estrid's unique sword. Estrid is known to have a **magic sword that is super sharp, has to feed off the undead**.|_Focus on the Sword:_ "That blade is extraordinary. A tool for great purpose. But tools need maintenance, and a special diet. We can find you prey to **feed** your purpose."|Estrid would feel a moment of grim respect, as few know about the sword's unique needs. This recognition of her **favorite item** is a sign that Ebonshade is a serious player.|
|**Offer the Intel:** Lady Ebonshade's primary goal is **Shadow Infiltration**. She offers intelligence that Estrid cannot acquire on her own.|_Focus on Weakness:_ "Our Whisperers hear things about his movements that the city councilors miss. We can give you a path. In return, the Covenant needs an _advantage_ against him."|Estrid, being a **brutish private eye, not as logical**, would be focused on the kill. She agrees to a trade: her **killing** services for their **intel** on Raunaeril.|

Phase 2: The Subtle Pivot (Introducing the Blood Vial)

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Justification:** She notes the high risk of tracking Raunaeril. Estrid's own **blood is a beacon** that draws him.|_Focus on the Nyxborn Trait:_ "Your lineage is a double-edged sword. You can find him, but he can also find _you_. To shield you from his senses, we need a catalyst for the necessary wards. Something intimately tied to the threat."|Estrid is **constantly paranoid her biological father will discover her**. The mention of a shield would be highly tempting. She might ask for specifics, ready to **kill for any small trespass**.|
|**The Direct Ask (The Deception):** She makes the request sound necessary for Estrid's protection, a minor cost for **forbidden rites** to amplify a **curse** against Raunaeril.|_Focus on the Vial:_ "We require one small vial of your blood. A drop of his own lineage, untainted by the Night Lord's current form, will allow us to twist the path, blinding him to his child. It's a key component for the _shield_."|Estrid would be hesitant. She **needs to kill** and this sounds like a delay. Her **child trauma** would make her suspect ulterior motives, but the promise of invisibility from her father is a powerful lure.|

Phase 3: Securing the Blood and the Deal

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Ultimatum:** Ebonshade uses the Covenant's power—their ability to perform a **forbidden rite**—as the leverage.|_Focus on Power:_ "You want him dead. We want the prestige of seeing him fall. We provide the intelligence and the shield. We have all the power in this city that flows beneath the streets. You cannot succeed without our Shadow Infiltration. Give us the catalyst."|Estrid, seeing the opportunity for the kill slip away, would likely acquiesce. Her **vengeful** nature overrides her fear of a **small trespass**. She will justify it as a necessary evil to **kill her dad**.|
|**The Close:** Ebonshade accepts the blood, offering a first piece of immediate, actionable intelligence to cement the deal, perhaps related to a mining conflict or the **Great Airship Race**, to prove the Covenant's worth.|_Focus on Action:_ "The ritual will begin immediately. Now, as promised, a whisper: We hear of a rare ore that Raunaeril's agents are looking for, deep in the dwarven districts. Find the ore, find the trail."|Estrid accepts the intelligence, takes the first steps toward the hunt, and leaves the **Low Ward** base, further convinced that the **Covenant** is a dangerous, yet necessary, ally.|
#### **Scene 2: Depart for Sunware Key**
 - Travel Time: 40hrs (400mi)
 - **Bosun** Aella Comler advises that if there is no airship dock that the [[Twilight Drift (ES Stallheart)|The Twilight Drift]] is able to moor to a regular pier but it will entail deflating the envelope which will take an hour or so to store properly. To take off will take approx. 4 hours to reheat the Shard Furnace and reinflate the envelope.

"As your airship cuts through the biting winds of the far northern seas, the imposing silhouette of Sunware Key rises from the steel-gray ocean. Dominating this fifty-mile island is the brooding peak of a great active volcano, its rim glowing with a dull, angry heat that vents a constant plume of ash into the freezing sky.

Below, tucked precariously between the volcano’s foothills and the churning sea, lies the village of [[Key Landing]]. From this height, the settlement looks like a cluster of hardy barnacles clinging to the coastline. It is a small place—no more than nine hundred souls —but as you descend, you notice the harbor is suspiciously large for such a remote town.

The docks are busy, crowded not just with small fishing skiffs working the shallows, but with larger trading vessels and naval ships that seem out of place in these frigid waters. Near the waterfront, a massive, blocky building stands out among the smaller homes—a converted warehouse that now clearly serves as the village’s main gathering hub. A single gravel track winds its way out of the village, disappearing into the volcanic rock and scrub of the island’s interior.

A mile or so off the coast of Key Landing, you see a small island cutting through the chop of the sea. It’s a rugged, lonely spit of land—only about 800 feet long —dominated by three barren, stony peaks that rise sharply above the water.

Nestled in the saddle between the hills sits a small stone fortress. From this height, you can see it is a two-story structure with a taller bell tower rising from the complex, watching over a walled courtyard filled with small gardens.

A single wooden pier extends from the north shore , but otherwise, the island appears quiet. 

As you near Sunware Key the air begins to warm ever so slightly, you presume due to the geothermal activity, making this island that should be frozen over, a paradise in the cold."
