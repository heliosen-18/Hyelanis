## ⏪ Recap of Last Session
**The Stargazer’s Flood & The Pirate’s Map**

**The Calm Before the Storm** We picked up shortly after your elevation to "Heroes of Val Taruum." You had secured your rewards—including 5 tons of fuel monthly and access to the Ancient Forge—and struck a secret, revolutionary accord with Councilor Willow Whisperwind to assassinate the "Night Lord."

**The Breach at the Eye** While the city slept, Harvin remained at the _Stargazer's Eye_, peering through the planar lens. He found what he was looking for—a vision of his family trapped within a bubble, protected by a Dragon Turtle. But the gaze went both ways.

The telescope shuddered and failed, bursting open to unleash a torrent of freezing, deep-ocean brine. From the high-pressure spray, a "Shade of Water"—an echo of the very Dragon Turtle protecting Harvin’s kin—manifested along with water weirds, flooding the observatory.

**Aftermath & Revelations** After defeating the elemental threat, the party regrouped.

- **Harvin’s Fury:** Harvin revealed the vision of his family to the group. In a moment of vulnerability and rage, he condemned the goddess Thassa, declaring that she has forsaken her followers and stolen his family solely for power—a conclusion drawn from his grief.
- **Damage Control:** Realizing the _Stargazer's Eye_ was wrecked, Harvin penned a careful letter to King Grimbeard, notifying him of the "malfunction" while diplomatically avoiding direct blame.
- **The Queen’s Curse:** Amidst the chaos, Harvin also began researching hexes and curses, seeking a way to aid the Queen with her necromantic affliction.

**The Path Forward** The session concluded with Rylan finally cracking the code of the treasure map. He linked it to the wreck of the _Tammeraut_, a war galley captained by the pirate sorcerer Syrgaul, located near **[[Sunware Key]]**.

With a departure date set for the **18th**, you prepared to leave the city, armed with a new Scroll of Waterbreathing and a heading toward buried secrets.
