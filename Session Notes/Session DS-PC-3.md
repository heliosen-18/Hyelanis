## ⏪ Recap of Last Session
The session opened with you being escorted in gilded carriages, a clear sign of your new status, to the Royal Audience Hall. There, a visibly exhausted but relieved King Grimbeard Stonebrow formally addressed you.

He thanked you for saving the city, declaring that the 'Clockwork Heart' of Val Taruum now 'beats pure and true.'

But his thanks quickly turned to a pressing inquiry. He grilled you for details, needing to understand the true nature of the 'devilry' you faced. He asked about:

- The breach into Mechanus and the corruption of chaos.
    
- The role of the [[The Deceiver – Phenax]] in this massive plot.
    
- The cost of your victory:  and his grave concern of what Phenax's plans are.

During this audience, Harvin, you presented the bones of Pipkin Geargrind, a moment of solemn closure. In response to your heroism, the King officially declared all of you 'Heroes of Val Taruum.' This title comes with significant perks and rewards: 
- Permanent berthing rights 
- A monthly stipend of [[Powdered Sordalite Fuel]] of 5 tons a month for the skyship.
- 1,500GP from the Dwarven Treasury
- special access to the city's Ancient Forge 
- 'get out of jail free card' for... future complications.

However, he left you with one very clear, unresolved request: He still wants the hammer _Whelm_ returned.

**Scene 3: A Revolutionary's Gambit**

Later, under the cover of night, you traveled to the 'Stargazer's Eye' observatory for your clandestine meeting with Councilor Willow Whisperwind. On a high platform, with the stars as your only witnesses, she laid her cards on the table.

She revealed her interest into the 'Night Lord' aka Estrid's father aka the 'Emperor Regent.' And she wants him dead.

Willow's motive is nothing short of revolution. She intends to use the power vacuum created by his assassination to fracture the empire and secure[[Finehold]]'s independence.

A deal was struck:

- **Willow will provide:** High-level intelligence, political cover, and access to airship manifests and security patrols to help you track down the Regent.
    
- **You will provide:** The assassination. Willow was clear that she needs advance notice of your plan so she can coordinate her political moves to seize the moment.
    

**Party Business & New Dangers**

Between these two major political encounters, you pursued your own goals:
- Rylan was able to tie the treasure map to [[Sunware Key]]
- **Everywhere:** You began looking into the logistics of building a proper altar for Heliod.
- **Harvin:** You expressed a desire to repair the Moss Wall, acting in your capacity as a Dwarven Emissary.
- **Alister:** You hit the books, purchasing six history tomes to brush up on your knowledge.
- **Estrid:** Your... _affinity_ for gambling was noted, as was your rather ambitious idea to kidnap the Heir to the Emperor.

A significant new threat also emerged: you learned that the Queen is suffering from a dire necromantic curse.

#### **Scene 1: Attack on Turtle**
##### Setting the Scene
###### Phase 1: The Warning
**(Read this part with a building sense of urgency. Start slow, then speed up.)**

"Harvin, your eye is still pressed to the planar lens, looking for the impossible, when the entire telescope apparatus _shudders_ violently.

You pull back, and everyone in the room can hear it: a deep, metallic **groan**. It's not a sound of gears, but of metal _bending_ under pressure it was never meant to hold. It sounds like a submarine's hull, seconds from collapse.

The brass casing around the main lens of the telescope begins to _warp_. You can see the metal itself _expanding_, bowing outwards. With a series of sharp **pings**, rivets pop from the telescope's body, shooting across the room like stray bullets."

**(Pause for a beat, then continue.)**

"And _that's_ when the first leaks appear. Not drips, but high-pressure **jets** of frigid, deep-blue water. They hiss like steam, blasting from the new holes, spraying the walls, the ceiling, and anyone too close. The room is instantly beginning to be filled with a freezing mist and the smell of ancient, deep-ocean brine."
###### Phase 2: The Breach
**(This part is fast, chaotic, and loud. Project your voice.)**

"The groaning stops. And for one, deafeningly silent second... nothing.

Then, with a **bang** that is less an explosion and more a sound of _total structural failure_, the main eyepiece shatters, and the entire back half of the telescope blows open.

It’s not a leak. It’s not a spray. It is a **nonstop, solid column** of dark, starlit water erupting from the breach. It smashes into the far wall with the force of a tidal wave, and the room _instantly_ begins to flood.

The force possibly knocks you off your feet. Books, scrolls, and small furniture are swept away in a sudden, icy river that's already ankle-deep in seconds. The water is _bitterly_ cold, and the torrent from the broken telescope shows no sign of stopping!"
###### Phase 3: The Emergence
**(Slow your pace here. Make it menacing and awe-inspiring.)**

"But the water... it's not just flooding the room. The main geyser bursting from the telescope is _not_ falling. It's... _coiling_.

The column of water begins to _rise_, defying gravity. It churns and gathers, pulling the floodwaters back into itself. Before your eyes, the raging torrent is _shaping itself_.

It takes on a form: a massive, reptilian head... a shell-like back... thick, powerful legs, all made of pure, raging, pressurized water.

**(Pause. Let them visualize it.)**

"It is a perfect, liquid _echo_ of the shadowy leviathan you saw, Harvin."

It rears up, towering to the ceiling, its new form constantly breaking apart in splashes, only to be instantly reformed by the endless pressure from the planar gateway. Its eyes are two pits of cold, empty void.

It opens its watery maw and lets out a **guttural roar**—not a sound of air, but the sound of the deep ocean, of grinding ice and immense pressure.

The link is no longer a _view_, It is a _doorway_."

**(Drop your voice to a clear, sharp command.)**

"Roll initiative."

#### **Scene 2: The Treasure Map
Tammeraut’s Fate
Several years ago, a fearsome pirate named Syrgaul sailed the sea aboard his war galley, _Tammeraut_. Syrgaul and his crew showed no mercy to those who crossed their path, killing the crews of those ships that fell prey to him.

Syrgaul was a mighty sorcerer, and his crew was bloodthirsty and skilled in both sailing and killing. Worse still, Syrgaul claimed allegiance to [[The Underking – Erebos]].

Erebos did indeed seem to favor Syrgaul, who often benefited from strong winds in his sails and swirling currents that prevented his prey from escaping. In return, the pirate captain made sacrifices to the God.

Syrgaul eventually met his end just over ten years ago. As he and his crew approached a naval post called Firewatch Island a small island of the coast of [[Sunware Key]] to plunder it, a priest garrisoned at the outpost implored the sea goddess [[The Quiet Siren – Thasa]], for mercy. Whether because of luck or because the cleric’s prayers were answered, a sudden storm swept through the area, capsizing _Tammeraut_ and sending the ship to the bottom of the sea.

**I've always dreamed of find the wreck of the Tammeraut and whatever treasure Captain Syrgaul had accumulated. 

#### **Scene 3: Lady Ebonshade**

The Covenant's base is hidden within a structural tunnel system beneath the Low Ward, the bottom-most level of the Unification Bridge. This placement leverages the level's more basic accommodations and workshops to camouflage its clandestine operations.

##### **The Entrance: The Forgotten Vent**

As characters approach the target location in the Low Ward:

- **Exterior Appearance:** The tunnel entrance is not a door, but a massive, rusted, and permanently sealed ventilation shaft grille set into the stone structure below one of the rough-hewn workshops. The stone around it is dark with grime and weeping with condensation from the bay below, and the air here is thick with the smells of damp stone, machine oil, and the fainter metallic scent from the nearby dwarven districts.
- **Camouflage:** The large grille is heavily marked with symbols in chalk and scorch marks—the residue of failed, abandoned **gnomish contraptions** or an old, non-functional **alchemical device**. This makes the opening look like a long-forgotten piece of industrial equipment, ignored by the workers and residents of the Low Ward.
- **The Activation:** The only way to open the grille is by performing a precise, silent ritual. If Lady Ebonshade or one of her agents were expecting the characters, a ripple of shadow magic—a momentary black spot deeper than any physical shadow—would pulse on the rusted metal. The grille would then silently _shift_, not swinging open, but seemingly dissolving into a shimmering, light-bending illusion, revealing a dark, tight passage beyond.

##### **The Interior: The Nexus of Whispers**

Beyond the illusion, the base is a blend of rough-hewn structural architecture and refined dark magic, perfectly suited for the Covenant’s activities of **Shadow Infiltration** and **Dark Bargains**.

1. **The Entry Tunnel (The "Veil"):**
    - **Architecture:** The passage is a narrow, claustrophobic maintenance tunnel, its stone walls slick with moisture and crisscrossed by thick, insulated pipes.
    - **The Ward:** A palpable, cold magical energy presses against the skin. This area is constantly saturated with shadow magic to **confuse and disorient** unwelcome intruders, making the space seem to shift and double back on itself (an applied gnomish illusion technique, but twisted with the Covenant's dark arts).
2. **The Hub (The Gathering Point):**
    - **Atmosphere:** The tunnel widens into a natural cavern or large structural chamber. The space is illuminated only by a few carefully controlled sources: faint, greenish-blue phosphorescent moss and the pale, cold light from a cluster of **cursed artifacts** contained behind wrought-iron grates.
    - **Lady Ebonshade's Presence:** This is where the **Mistress of Whispers** conducts her business. She would be seated near the center, her long, raven-black hair seeming to **meld with the shadows around her**.
    - **Acoustics:** Despite being so close to the bridge's support structure, the room is eerily quiet. The sound of the thrumming bridge above is almost completely muted by powerful, magical sound-dampening wards, ensuring that the **secrets extracted from the most guarded minds** are never heard by the outside world.

##### **The Discussions**

Phase 1: Establishing Mutual Gain and Acknowledging the Target

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**Acknowledge the Mission:** She would immediately confirm she knows _why_ Estrid is there, using the organization's reputation for **espionage**.|_Focus on Raunaeril:_ "The Night Lord is a slippery shadow, even for us. Your desire for **vengeance** is noted, but he does not fall to common steel."|Estrid is **paranoid** and **hates shapeshifters**. She would be terse, demanding proof of the Covenant's resources and capability to deal with a powerful entity like her father, the **originator of vampires**.|
|**Praise the Weapon:** She would display knowledge of Estrid's unique sword. Estrid is known to have a **magic sword that is super sharp, has to feed off the undead**.|_Focus on the Sword:_ "That blade is extraordinary. A tool for great purpose. But tools need maintenance, and a special diet. We can find you prey to **feed** your purpose."|Estrid would feel a moment of grim respect, as few know about the sword's unique needs. This recognition of her **favorite item** is a sign that Ebonshade is a serious player.|
|**Offer the Intel:** Lady Ebonshade's primary goal is **Shadow Infiltration**. She offers intelligence that Estrid cannot acquire on her own.|_Focus on Weakness:_ "Our Whisperers hear things about his movements that the city councilors miss. We can give you a path. In return, the Covenant needs an _advantage_ against him."|Estrid, being a **brutish private eye, not as logical**, would be focused on the kill. She agrees to a trade: her **killing** services for their **intel** on Raunaeril.|

Phase 2: The Subtle Pivot (Introducing the Blood Vial)

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Justification:** She notes the high risk of tracking Raunaeril. Estrid's own **blood is a beacon** that draws him.|_Focus on the Nyxborn Trait:_ "Your lineage is a double-edged sword. You can find him, but he can also find _you_. To shield you from his senses, we need a catalyst for the necessary wards. Something intimately tied to the threat."|Estrid is **constantly paranoid her biological father will discover her**. The mention of a shield would be highly tempting. She might ask for specifics, ready to **kill for any small trespass**.|
|**The Direct Ask (The Deception):** She makes the request sound necessary for Estrid's protection, a minor cost for **forbidden rites** to amplify a **curse** against Raunaeril.|_Focus on the Vial:_ "We require one small vial of your blood. A drop of his own lineage, untainted by the Night Lord's current form, will allow us to twist the path, blinding him to his child. It's a key component for the _shield_."|Estrid would be hesitant. She **needs to kill** and this sounds like a delay. Her **child trauma** would make her suspect ulterior motives, but the promise of invisibility from her father is a powerful lure.|

Phase 3: Securing the Blood and the Deal

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Ultimatum:** Ebonshade uses the Covenant's power—their ability to perform a **forbidden rite**—as the leverage.|_Focus on Power:_ "You want him dead. We want the prestige of seeing him fall. We provide the intelligence and the shield. We have all the power in this city that flows beneath the streets. You cannot succeed without our Shadow Infiltration. Give us the catalyst."|Estrid, seeing the opportunity for the kill slip away, would likely acquiesce. Her **vengeful** nature overrides her fear of a **small trespass**. She will justify it as a necessary evil to **kill her dad**.|
|**The Close:** Ebonshade accepts the blood, offering a first piece of immediate, actionable intelligence to cement the deal, perhaps related to a mining conflict or the **Great Airship Race**, to prove the Covenant's worth.|_Focus on Action:_ "The ritual will begin immediately. Now, as promised, a whisper: We hear of a rare ore that Raunaeril's agents are looking for, deep in the dwarven districts. Find the ore, find the trail."|Estrid accepts the intelligence, takes the first steps toward the hunt, and leaves the **Low Ward** base, further convinced that the **Covenant** is a dangerous, yet necessary, ally.|
