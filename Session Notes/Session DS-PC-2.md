## 🎯 Next Steps & Goals (Pre-Game Prep)

### 1. The Strong Start
- Estrid's receives the Sending spell answers:
	- Kiran "Be wary of the shadows in Val Taruum. The Shadowed Covenant's actions have been detected. [[Lady Ebonshade]]'s presence is known. She is shrouded in darkness."
	- Amara "I am familiar with Councilor [[Willow Whisperwind]], an advisor to Queen Glimmerwing. She is politically astute and has access to high-level government information. Be careful."
-

#### **Scene 1: The Audience with King Grimbeard Stonebrow**

**Setting:** The Val Taruum Royal Audience Hall. The King is seated, looking exhausted but deeply relieved. The room is packed with the court, advisors, and royal guards. The steady, powerful _thrum_ of the stabilized Clockwork Heart is palpable.

##### **King Grimbeard Stonebrow's Opening Speech**

The King rises slowly, his movements heavy but commanding, and regards the party with a look of profound relief.

> "Silence! The adventurers who dared to venture into the maelstrom stand before us. I confess, there were days I thought this city would collapse into chaos, swallowed by the violet storms that choked our skies. The great **Clockwork Heart** of Val Taruum was a mad, desperate drumbeat—a sign of the encroaching end."
> 
> "But now... the heart beats pure and true. The air is clean, and the violet madness is gone. You faced whatever cosmic horror plagued us, and you succeeded. The city is safe."
> 
> **"You saved Val Taruum. Now, tell me, heroes: What devilry did you face in the deep, and what impossible act did you perform to cleanse the Heart of Val Taruum?"**

##### **The King's Inquiries**

Once the party has given their initial account of the mission, King Grimbeard would shift from gruff gratitude to pragmatic concern, seeking to understand the full scope of the danger.

These questions are designed to extract the major plot points (The Primus corruption, Phenax's involvement, and the Divine Seeds) that the King needs to know for the next arc:

1. **On the Nature of the Threat:**
    
    > "You say this was no mere elemental chaos, but a breach into the mechanical plane of **Mechanus**? You mean to tell me a god, **Primus**, ruler of that plane, was the _source_ of the chaos? What could possibly corrupt a being of pure law and order?"
    
2. **On the True Mastermind:**
    
    > "A shadowy influence—a 'Returned God of Deceit' named **Phenax**? Is this fiend working to gather power from planar tears? Is he truly using our city’s Clockwork Heart as a key to his mad ambition? I want names, places, and methods. How close did he come to his goal?"
    
3. **On the Fix and the Cost:**
    
    > "The final act that stabilized the Heart—the surge of pure energy you unleashed. You used the power of the **Divine Seeds** you carry, did you not? What was the true nature of the device you implemented, and does this success come with a cost? Does this 'Phenax' now know you carry what he seeks?"
    
4. **On the Global Implications:**
    
    > "If this villain's goal is to target and perhaps dethrone the sun god **Heliod**, then this threat extends far beyond Val Taruum. What knowledge did you gain that can help us warn the other great kingdoms? Where do we look next for signs of this Phenax's hand?"

##### **Reward** 
- Permanent berthing rights 
- A monthly stipend of [[Powdered Sordalite Fuel]] of 5 tons a month for the skyship.
- 1,500GP from the Dwarven Treasury

#### **Scene 2: Lady Ebonshade**
The Covenant's base is hidden within a structural tunnel system beneath the Low Ward**, the bottom-most level of the Unification Bridge. This placement leverages the level's **more basic accommodations and workshops** to camouflage its clandestine operations.

##### **The Entrance: The Forgotten Vent**
As characters approach the target location in the Low Ward:
- **Exterior Appearance:** The tunnel entrance is not a door, but a massive, rusted, and permanently sealed ventilation shaft grille set into the stone structure below one of the rough-hewn workshops. The stone around it is dark with grime and weeping with condensation from the bay below, and the air here is thick with the smells of damp stone, machine oil, and the fainter metallic scent from the nearby dwarven districts.
- **Camouflage:** The large grille is heavily marked with symbols in chalk and scorch marks—the residue of failed, abandoned **gnomish contraptions** or an old, non-functional **alchemical device**. This makes the opening look like a long-forgotten piece of industrial equipment, ignored by the workers and residents of the Low Ward.
- **The Activation:** The only way to open the grille is by performing a precise, silent ritual. If Lady Ebonshade or one of her agents were expecting the characters, a ripple of shadow magic—a momentary black spot deeper than any physical shadow—would pulse on the rusted metal. The grille would then silently _shift_, not swinging open, but seemingly dissolving into a shimmering, light-bending illusion, revealing a dark, tight passage beyond.
##### **The Interior: The Nexus of Whispers**
Beyond the illusion, the base is a blend of rough-hewn structural architecture and refined dark magic, perfectly suited for the Covenant’s activities of **Shadow Infiltration** and **Dark Bargains**.

1. **The Entry Tunnel (The "Veil"):**
    - **Architecture:** The passage is a narrow, claustrophobic maintenance tunnel, its stone walls slick with moisture and crisscrossed by thick, insulated pipes.
    - **The Ward:** A palpable, cold magical energy presses against the skin. This area is constantly saturated with shadow magic to **confuse and disorient** unwelcome intruders, making the space seem to shift and double back on itself (an applied gnomish illusion technique, but twisted with the Covenant's dark arts).
2. **The Hub (The Gathering Point):**
    - **Atmosphere:** The tunnel widens into a natural cavern or large structural chamber. The space is illuminated only by a few carefully controlled sources: faint, greenish-blue phosphorescent moss and the pale, cold light from a cluster of **cursed artifacts** contained behind wrought-iron grates.
    - **Lady Ebonshade's Presence:** This is where the **Mistress of Whispers** conducts her business. She would be seated near the center, her long, raven-black hair seeming to **meld with the shadows around her**.
    - **Acoustics:** Despite being so close to the bridge's support structure, the room is eerily quiet. The sound of the thrumming bridge above is almost completely muted by powerful, magical sound-dampening wards, ensuring that the **secrets extracted from the most guarded minds** are never heard by the outside world.

##### **The Discussions**
Phase 1: Establishing Mutual Gain and Acknowledging the Target

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**Acknowledge the Mission:** She would immediately confirm she knows _why_ Estrid is there, using the organization's reputation for **espionage**.|_Focus on Raunaeril:_ "The Night Lord is a slippery shadow, even for us. Your desire for **vengeance** is noted, but he does not fall to common steel."|Estrid is **paranoid** and **hates shapeshifters**. She would be terse, demanding proof of the Covenant's resources and capability to deal with a powerful entity like her father, the **originator of vampires**.|
|**Praise the Weapon:** She would display knowledge of Estrid's unique sword. Estrid is known to have a **magic sword that is super sharp, has to feed off the undead**.|_Focus on the Sword:_ "That blade is extraordinary. A tool for great purpose. But tools need maintenance, and a special diet. We can find you prey to **feed** your purpose."|Estrid would feel a moment of grim respect, as few know about the sword's unique needs. This recognition of her **favorite item** is a sign that Ebonshade is a serious player.|
|**Offer the Intel:** Lady Ebonshade's primary goal is **Shadow Infiltration**. She offers intelligence that Estrid cannot acquire on her own.|_Focus on Weakness:_ "Our Whisperers hear things about his movements that the city councilors miss. We can give you a path. In return, the Covenant needs an _advantage_ against him."|Estrid, being a **brutish private eye, not as logical**, would be focused on the kill. She agrees to a trade: her **killing** services for their **intel** on Raunaeril.|
Phase 2: The Subtle Pivot (Introducing the Blood Vial)

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Justification:** She notes the high risk of tracking Raunaeril. Estrid's own **blood is a beacon** that draws him.|_Focus on the Nyxborn Trait:_ "Your lineage is a double-edged sword. You can find him, but he can also find _you_. To shield you from his senses, we need a catalyst for the necessary wards. Something intimately tied to the threat."|Estrid is **constantly paranoid her biological father will discover her**. The mention of a shield would be highly tempting. She might ask for specifics, ready to **kill for any small trespass**.|
|**The Direct Ask (The Deception):** She makes the request sound necessary for Estrid's protection, a minor cost for **forbidden rites** to amplify a **curse** against Raunaeril.|_Focus on the Vial:_ "We require one small vial of your blood. A drop of his own lineage, untainted by the Night Lord's current form, will allow us to twist the path, blinding him to his child. It's a key component for the _shield_."|Estrid would be hesitant. She **needs to kill** and this sounds like a delay. Her **child trauma** would make her suspect ulterior motives, but the promise of invisibility from her father is a powerful lure.|
Phase 3: Securing the Blood and the Deal

|**Lady Ebonshade's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Estrid's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Ultimatum:** Ebonshade uses the Covenant's power—their ability to perform a **forbidden rite**—as the leverage.|_Focus on Power:_ "You want him dead. We want the prestige of seeing him fall. We provide the intelligence and the shield. We have all the power in this city that flows beneath the streets. You cannot succeed without our Shadow Infiltration. Give us the catalyst."|Estrid, seeing the opportunity for the kill slip away, would likely acquiesce. Her **vengeful** nature overrides her fear of a **small trespass**. She will justify it as a necessary evil to **kill her dad**.|
|**The Close:** Ebonshade accepts the blood, offering a first piece of immediate, actionable intelligence to cement the deal, perhaps related to a mining conflict or the **Great Airship Race**, to prove the Covenant's worth.|_Focus on Action:_ "The ritual will begin immediately. Now, as promised, a whisper: We hear of a rare ore that Raunaeril's agents are looking for, deep in the dwarven districts. Find the ore, find the trail."|Estrid accepts the intelligence, takes the first steps toward the hunt, and leaves the **Low Ward** base, further convinced that the **Covenant** is a dangerous, yet necessary, ally.|

#### **Scene 3: Meeting with the Councilor**
##### **The Stargazer's Eye: Location and Atmosphere**

The Stargazer's Eye is a towering structure located in **Whisperwind Heights**, the gnomish district built on the highest hills overlooking Val Taruum.

- **Structure and Purpose:** It is an observatory housing powerful telescopes and magical instruments used by gnomish astronomers to study the cosmos and chart the courses of airships.
    
- **Key Feature:** The tower features a **retractable roof** that allows for **unobstructed views of the stars**.
    
- **Meeting Point:** Estrid and Willow meet on the **highest platform just beneath the retractable roof**.
    
    - This location provides **clear sightlines** across the city and **Wakabron Bay**, aligning with Estrid's constant paranoia and need for an escape route.
        
    - The wide, open area ensures minimal witnesses, crucial for a high-stakes, clandestine discussion involving the murder of the **Emperor Regent**.
        
    - The gnomish setting of **innovation** and **pushing boundaries** aligns with Willow's radical goal of breaking up the empire.
        

**The Ambience of the Meeting**
The meeting takes place late at night, under the open sky:

- **Lighting:** The area is lit only by the pale starlight pouring through the open roof and the soft, magical glow of gnomish instruments used for charting.
    
- **Sound:** The only sounds are the whistling wind off the bay, the very faint distant hum of life from the city below, and the quiet, almost imperceptible ticking of the observatory's magical, clockwork instruments.
    
- **Tension:** This backdrop of vast cosmic indifference heightens the tension of their treasonous agreement: a diplomat trading **political cover and high-level intel** for a **brutish private eye's** service in assassinating the Emperor Regent.
##### **The Discussion:**

|**Estrid's Action**|**Dialogue/Focus Pointers**|**Willow's Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Introduction (The Shock):** Estrid arrives, expecting to trade Shadowed Veil intel for logistics data. Willow immediately cuts to the chase, revealing her true objective and Raunaeril's title.|_Focus on the Title/Empire:_ "You are hunting the 'Night Lord,' the **Emperor Regent** [custom change, cite: Estrid, Raunaeril Xistrith]. I want him dead more than you do, as his removal is the key to fracturing this empire and gaining true independence for **Finehold** [custom change, cite: Val Taruum, Val Taruum Lore and Events]."|Estrid is surprised that her father is _that_ important. She will be suspicious, viewing Willow's political goal as a potential distraction or trap, demanding to know how a gnome councilor could possibly know her deepest secret.|
|**The Alignment (The Strategy):** Willow validates Estrid's mission by acknowledging the severity of Raunaeril's nature and aligning their goals (kill the Regent) while downplaying the political risk for Estrid.|_Focus on the Common Goal:_ "He is an **originator of vampires** and a tyrant. Your personal vengeance **justifies killing**. My goal is to use the resulting chaos to secure my people's freedom. Your knife and my network are perfectly aligned."|Estrid, who **justifies killing for vengeance**, respects directness and the finality of the act. She accepts the immediate alignment but makes it clear her motive is **personal, not political**.|
|**The Trade (The Critical Information):** Willow offers full access to the high-level intelligence Estrid needs, providing political cover and advanced warning of any Imperial retaliation.|_Focus on Logistical Cover:_ "I can provide complete access to **Airship Construction** manifests, diplomatic schedules, and internal security patrols. This intelligence will let you track him and operate without Imperial forces knowing you are here to kill the Regent. We will make sure your mission looks like a **personal vendetta**, not a political assassination."|Estrid needs this information, as she is currently **struggling to make a name for herself** and needs **connections**. She agrees, demanding the information be delivered via coded messages to avoid any traceable link.|
|**The Condition (The Control):** Willow establishes control, ensuring Estrid acts only when it serves the revolution.|_Focus on Timing:_ "You must strike when the time is right. Give me advance notice of your plan. In return for the high-level intelligence that can find your father, I need to know when the empire will break. When you move, I move. You get the kill; I get the revolution."|Estrid, who is **not as logical** as Willow, accepts this condition grudgingly. She is focused on the **Goal: Victor trained her to kill her dad** and agrees to the timeline, seeing the advanced intel as worth the small concession of strategy.|

### Next Session Planning Hook
#### Harvin Mini Session

**(Begin with a calm, direct tone, setting the scene for Harvin.)**

"Harvin. Place your eye to the lens. It's working... the planar alignments are locking into place. The view... it's stabilizing. Focus on your intent."

**(Pause. Now, switch to the descriptive "read-aloud" text.)**

> _The view swims from a blur into a crushing, endless, abyssal blue. It's an ocean without a surface, without a floor—an infinite liquid expanse lit by a distant, sun-like luminescence from some unseen source._
> 
> _Suspended in this vast, watery void, you see it: **a perfect, shimmering, crystalline bubble.** It glows faintly, like captured starlight._
> 
> _Inside the bubble, there is no water. It's a small, contained pocket of... something else. An ethereal echo of a medieval home—a fireplace, a table, chairs—all rendered in soft, shimmering light, like a memory given form._

**(Switch back to a direct, more intense address.)**

"And there, Harvin. Inside... **It's Frigga and Penelope.**"

**(Pause. Let that sink in. Then, switch back to description for his analysis.)**

> _As a necromancer, you recognize what you're seeing instantly. They are not physical. They are not ghosts, not in the way you understand them. They are pure **anima**. Their essential souls, glowing with a soft, pearlescent light._
> 
> _They float gently, eyes closed, in a state of absolute, dreamless stasis. They look peaceful... but it is the utter, unnerving stillness of a specimen preserved in amber._

**(Switch to a direct address, guiding his focus.)**

"Now, look closer, Harvin. At the bubble itself. The construct."

**(Switch to description for the final, damning details.)**

> _Etched onto the sphere's very surface, glowing with a cold, blue energy, is the unmistakable **Bident of Thasa.** Her divine sigil. A mark of ownership._
> 
> _And... behind the bubble..._
> 
> _In the murky, abyssal depths, a colossal, indistinct shadow lurks. You can't make it out clearly, but you see the suggestion of a massive, spiked shell... a reptilian head... a leviathan, guarding its prize._

**(End with a final, direct address to provoke a reaction.)**

"They are not gone, Harvin. But they are not free. They are... _kept_. Preserved. A divine collection."

"What do you do?"
