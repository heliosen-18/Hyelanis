_**Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook.**_ A Wizard spell on a _Spell Scroll_ can be copied into a spellbook. When a spell is copied in this way, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check with a DC equal to 10 plus the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the _Spell Scroll_ is destroyed.

#### Scribing Spell Scrolls

A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a [Spell Scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll), using the rules below.

##### Time and Cost

Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money based on the level of the spell, as shown in the [Spell Scroll Costs table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#SpellScrollCosts). For each day of inscription, you must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple days, those days needn’t be consecutive.

##### Prerequisites for the Scribe

To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) skill or with [Calligrapher’s Supplies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/404-calligraphers-supplies) and have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

##### Cantrips

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.

##### Spell Scroll Costs
|Spell Level|Time|Cost|
|---|---|---|
|Cantrip|1 day|15 GP|
|1|1 day|25 GP|
|2|3 days|100 GP|
|3|5 days|150 GP|
|4|10 days|1,000 GP|
|5|25 days|1,500 GP|
|6|40 days|10,000 GP|
|7|50 days|12,500 GP|
|8|60 days|15,000 GP|
|9|120 days|50,000 GP|
