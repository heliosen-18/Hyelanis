**Dialogue:**  
"By the beard of Moradin! You have done it, adventurers! The portal is open, and the Clockwork Heart is still beating. But... it's not where we expected it to be. It's... dormant. Suspended in the air, just beyond the portal's edge. Like a beacon, waiting for something."  
**Adventurers:**  
"What do you mean, dormant? And what's waiting for it?"  
**King Mightyhammer**  
"I don't know, but it's clear that this portal is more than just a gateway to another world. It's a... catalyst. Something is drawing the Clockwork Heart to it, and I fear that once it's fully drawn in, the consequences will be dire."  
**Adventurers:**  
"So, what do we do now? Do we try to reach the Clockwork Heart through the portal?"  
**King Mightyhammer**  
"That's the million-dollar question, adventurers. I don't know if we can reach it, or if we should even try. But one thing is certain: we can't let it fall into the wrong hands. Whoever or whatever is behind this, they're up to no good."  
**Adventurers:**  
"So, what do you propose we do, Your Majesty?"  
**King Mightyhammer**  
"I propose we keep a close eye on the portal. Monitor it, study it, and try to understand what's going on. And in the meantime, we prepare. We gather our forces, sharpen our weapons, and prepare for whatever may come through that portal."  
**Adventurers:**  
"We're with you, Your Majesty. We won't let anything come through that portal and threaten our world."  
**King Mightyhammer**  
"Good. Then let us stand together, adventurers, and face whatever challenges may come our way."  
**End of Dialogue**
   

Here is a stream of dialogue concerning Whelm the Mighty, a sentient magic warhammer, as the adventurers are in court with King Mightyhammer:  
**Adventurers:** (Holding up the warhammer) "Your Majesty, we present to you Whelm the Mighty. We believe it holds the key to preventing the Clockwork Heart from being drawn into the portal."  
**King Mightyhammer:** (Eyes narrowing) "Whelm the Mighty? That... that's an ancient relic of my clan. A weapon of great power, forged by my ancestors in the First Age. But sentient? That's unheard of."  
**Whelm the Mighty's Voice:** (A deep, resonant voice emanates from the hammer) "Mightyhammer... King Mightyhammer... my King. It is I, Whelm. I have waited centuries for this moment."  
**Court:** (Gasps erupt from the assembled dwarves)  
**King Mightyhammer:** (Stuttering) "W-who said that?"  
**Whelm the Mighty's Voice:** "This vessel... this hammer... it has held me captive for far too long. I, Borin Stonehand, master smith and architect of [[The Moss Wall]], was bound within this metal by my own hand to protect it from the very forces that now threaten this land."  
**King Mightyhammer:** (Confused) "Borin Stonehand? You built [[The Moss Wall]]?"  
**Whelm the Mighty's Voice:** "Aye, King. And now, I must return. The Wall is weakening, its magic fading. I must reclaim my place and mend the rift before it's too late."  
**Adventurers:** "So, you want us to take you to [[The Moss Wall]]?"  
**Whelm the Mighty's Voice:** "Indeed. Only then can I be free, and only then can I truly help you protect this realm."  
**King Mightyhammer:** (Thinking) "This is... unprecedented. A sentient weapon, a hero of old... trapped within a relic. What do you say, adventurers? Are you willing to help this... this spirit?"  
**Adventurers:** (Looking at each other) "We'll do it, Your Majesty. For the King, and for the realm!"  
**Whelm the Mighty's Voice:** "Then let us go. Time is of the essence."  
And so, the adventurers, with the sentient warhammer Whelm the Mighty in hand, embark on a new quest to [[The Moss Wall]], a journey fraught with danger and uncertainty, but with the promise of restoring balance to the land.  
**If you'd like, tell me more about the adventurers or [[The Moss Wall]], and I can expand on the dialogue further!**
