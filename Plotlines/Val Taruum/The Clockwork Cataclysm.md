# [[The Rift Reavers]]' Plan:

- Objective: To open a rift to Mechanus and disrupt its perfect order, creating a ripple effect that weakens the barriers between [[The Planes]]. This would make it easier for them to open rifts to other planes in the future, furthering their goal of harnessing planar energies.
- Method: They plan to use the Clockwork Heart as a conduit, believing its intricate mechanisms and magical energy can be attuned to Mechanus's frequencies. They might need to modify the Clockwork Heart or perform a ritual to establish the connection.
- Timing: They might be waiting for a specific celestial alignment or a moment of magical surge to amplify their efforts and increase the chances of success.

The Modron Invasion:

- Unforeseen Consequence: As [[The Rift Reavers]] tamper with the Clockwork Heart and establish a connection to Mechanus, they inadvertently open a gateway for modrons to enter the Material Plane.
- Hostile Intent: These modrons, however, are not the typical clockwork servants of Primus. They are a rogue faction, perhaps corrupted or driven by a distorted sense of order, and they see [[Val Taruum]] as a chaotic mess that needs to be "fixed."
- Enforcing Order: The modrons invade [[Val Taruum]], attempting to impose their rigid order on the city. This could involve:
    - Disrupting the city's functions: They might try to shut down the Clockwork Heart, halt airship traffic, or impose strict curfews and regulations.
    - Transforming the environment: They might try to reshape the city into a perfectly ordered grid, removing any elements of whimsy or organic design.
    - Subjugating the population: They might try to control the gnomes and dwarves, forcing them to conform to their rigid routines and behaviors.
 
# Mission from [[Lady Ebonshade]]

**[[Lady Ebonshade]]:** "[[Harvin]], you have proven yourself a valuable asset to [[The Shadowed Covenant]]. Now, a new task awaits you, one that will test your loyalty and resourcefulness."    
**[[Harvin]]:** "I am ready to serve, [[Lady Ebonshade]]. What is your command?"    
**[[Lady Ebonshade]]:** "There is a disturbance in the threads of fate, a shadow looming over [[Val Taruum]]. An ancient power being tampered with within the city, a power that could shatter the veil between worlds and unleash chaos, or order, upon the land."    
**[[Harvin]]:** "What is the source of this power? How can I stop it?"    
**[[Lady Ebonshade]]:** "The answers lie hidden within the Great Library of Taruum. Seek out a forgotten prophecy, a secret whispered among the ancients, a song of the gears. It will guide you to the heart of the disturbance, the key to restoring balance."    
**[[Harvin]]:** "I will find this prophecy. I will not fail you."    
**[[Lady Ebonshade]]:** "Go, [[Harvin]]. The fate of [[Val Taruum]] hangs in the balance. Be swift, be discreet, and may the shadows guide your path."

# The Ritual

**The What**

1. **Attunement:** [[The Rift Reavers]] must first attune the Clockwork Heart to Mechanus by inscribing specific runes and symbols onto its gears and components. These runes act as resonators, harmonizing the Clockwork Heart's magical frequencies with those of Mechanus.  
2. **Catalytic Focus:** They will use a catalytic focus, a complete set of Clockwork Armor (Plate) attuned to Mechanus, to amplify their magical energies and channel them into the Clockwork Heart. This focus acts as a conduit, bridging [[The Gap]] between the Material Plane and Mechanus.  
3. **Planar Channeling:** [[The Rift Reavers]] will then perform a synchronized incantation, channeling their combined magical power into the Clockwork Heart. This incantation will weave a tapestry of planar energies, creating a resonance that attracts the attention of Mechanus and weakens the barriers between [[The Planes]].
4. **Culmination:** At the culmination of the ritual, the Clockwork Heart will surge with power, its gears and mechanisms spinning in a frenzy as a rift to Mechanus tears open. The rift will appear as a shimmering portal, swirling with the white light and geometric patterns characteristic of Mechanus.  

**The How**

1. **Preparation:** [[The Rift Reavers]] will likely spend days or even weeks preparing for the ritual, carefully studying the Clockwork Heart's design, inscribing the necessary runes, and gathering the required components. They might need to infiltrate the Clockwork Heart's chamber or disable security measures to gain access.  
2. **Synchronization:** The ritual requires precise timing and coordination among [[The Rift Reavers]]. They might need to perform specific actions or chant incantations in unison, aligning their efforts with celestial events or moments of magical surge.
3. **Containment:** [[The Rift Reavers]] might also need to set up containment measures to prevent the rift from destabilizing or expanding uncontrollably. This could involve creating magical barriers, using stabilizing artifacts, or even sacrificing individuals to absorb the excess planar energy.
4. **Defense:** During the ritual, [[The Rift Reavers]] will be vulnerable to attack or disruption. They might station guards, create illusions, or set traps to protect themselves from interference.
 
# The Dream

The whirring and clicking of gears fades into a rhythmic drone as your consciousness drifts away from the Inner Core. You find yourself no longer surrounded by gnomes and their contraptions, but by an endless expanse of polished brass and gleaming steel. Giant cogs, the size of city blocks, mesh and rotate with hypnotic precision, their movements generating a symphony of mechanical sounds that reverberates through your very being.
 
You stand on a platform, seemingly suspended in an infinite void. Above and below, colossal gears stretch into the distance, their surfaces adorned with intricate patterns and glowing runes that pulse with an otherworldly light. Strange, geometric creatures move with unwavering purpose across the gears, their bodies a symphony of angles and planes. They come in many differing forms, but the most common resemble a small, metallic sphere with a single, unblinking eye. It has four stubby legs and two tiny arms, and it moves with a jerky, almost comical gait. Each of these creatures seems to have a designated role, a specific function within the grand machine of realm. They march in perfect formation, their movements synchronized with the rhythmic churning of the gears.
 
Suddenly, you hear the beating of what sounds like a heartbeat… a colossal rift tears open the fabric of reality, a jagged wound in the otherwise perfect order of this realm. It begins as a shimmering purple distortion, a localized disruption in the geometric patterns that adorn the gears. This distortion rapidly intensifies, growing into a pulsating vortex of energy that crackles and spits with raw power. The edges of the rift are jagged and unstable, constantly shifting and reforming as if reality itself is struggling to contain the breach. Through the swirling chaos, glimpses of [[Val Taruum]] can be seen, fragmented and distorted like reflections in a broken mirror. The familiar sights of the city – the bustling markets, the towering spires, the winding canals – are twisted and warped, as if viewed through a kaleidoscope.
 
The air crackles with an eerie energy, and a low, guttural hum emanates from the rift, growing louder and more intense as the opening widens. The gears surrounding the rift begin to spin erratically, their movements no longer synchronized with the harmonious rhythm of this place. The creatures in the vicinity are thrown into disarray, their normally unwavering formations disrupted by the chaotic energy.
 
Then, with a final surge of power, the rift stabilizes, forming a gaping maw in the fabric of reality. The chaotic energy subsides, replaced by an eerie calm. The gears resume their rhythmic rotation, but now their movements are subtly altered, their rhythm now influenced by the chaotic energies of [[Val Taruum]].  
Through the stabilized rift, a clear view of [[Val Taruum]] is revealed, but it's not the city the dreamer remembers.  
The Clockwork Heart, once a symbol of the city's ingenuity, now pulsates with a malevolent red light, its gears spinning with uncontrolled frenzy.
 
A wave of these creatures, their numbers immeasurable, surges through the rift, their march relentless and unstoppable. They pour into [[Val Taruum]], their geometric forms a stark contrast to the organic chaos of the city. The creatures begin their work, their purpose singular and absolute: to impose order upon the chaotic world. Buildings are deconstructed and rebuilt with geometric precision. Streets are reconfigured into perfect grids. The citizens of [[Val Taruum]] are assimilated into a perfect hierarchy, their individuality subsumed by the collective will of order.
 
The dream shifts, and you find yourself observing the creatures march from above. The city, once a vibrant tapestry of life and activity, is now a cold, sterile machine, its inhabitants mere cogs in the grand mechanism of order. The Clockwork Heart, the source of the rift, pulsates at the center of it all, a malevolent beacon of order in a world consumed by chaos.
 
You awaken with a gasp, the rhythmic churning of the Clockwork Heart echoing in your ears. The dream lingers, a chilling vision of a possible future where [[Val Taruum]] falls victim to the relentless order. You are left with two ideas stuck at the forefront of your brain. Mechanus requires absolute order and the Modrons March without end.
