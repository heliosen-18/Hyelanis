Each player will be introduced into a small dungeon one by one akin to the maze runner. After a puzzle or trial that is associated with a potential god connection. A new section of the dungeon will be opened and the next character will be introduced. This will take the place of a session zero and the players should be level two and then level up upon completion.
 
The entire situation is orchestrated by Phenax, god of deception.
 
After the trials are completed by all of the players will find themselves inside one of the crypt dedicated to Erebos, god of death, found in the graveyard Crypts of the Old in [[Hyelanis/Bastion Reach/Darem Notch]].

The small square ancient looking chamber is made of rough-hewn stone blocks. The walls are bare, and the only light comes from a small crack high up in the ceiling. The floor is covered in a thick layer of dust.  
In the center of the room is a faceless statue. It is made of black stone, and it stands about six feet tall. The statue is of a human figure, but it has no facial features. Its arms are outstretched, and its hands are held palms up.  
There are three doorways in the chamber, one on each wall. The doorways are all made of the same rough-hewn stone blocks as the walls. They are all closed, and there is no way to tell where they lead. Above each door is a single word.  
The chamber is silent and still. The only sound is the faint sound of wind blowing through the crack high up in the ceiling.
