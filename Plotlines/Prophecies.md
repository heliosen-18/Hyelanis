"A reconciliation must occur" suggests that there is a conflict, dispute, or division that needs to be resolved or healed. This could be between individuals, groups, nations, or even within oneself.
 
"The saffron page shall not compound" likely refers to a particular entity, character, or group that has the potential to exacerbate the conflict or make the situation worse. The saffron color might have symbolic significance, representing either a specific person or group known for their involvement in the conflict or a quality associated with them (e.g., pride, arrogance, ambition).
