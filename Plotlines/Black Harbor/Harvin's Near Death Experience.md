The mist, thick and cold, presses against you, a tangible presence in this strange, in-between place. You feel adrift, untethered, yet acutely aware. Through the swirling gray, you see him – Athreos, the Ferryman, his dark cowl obscuring his face as he drags his ferry onto the pebbled shore. The River Lethe, usually a calm flow towards oblivion, churns and roils with an unnatural energy. "Phenax," he growled, his voice a low rumble that echoed across the water. "You have a knack for appearing when least desired."
 
Then, from the depths of the swirling mist, another figure emerges. Phenax, the Deceiver, his form shrouded in whispers and a violet haze, his face obscured behind his golden mask. "Ah, Athreos," he purrs, his voice a silken rasp that seems to slither through the air. "Always a pleasure to encounter your… _enthusiasm_." He gestures towards the agitated river with a flourish. "I trust you've been keeping busy?"
 
Athreos grips his pole, knuckles bone-white. "Busy enough, thanks to your meddling and the Underking's schemes." His voice, a low rumble that vibrates through your very essence, is laced with barely contained fury. "Another soul needing to be returned. One of your 'Seeds', I presume?"
 
Phenax chuckles, a dry, chilling sound like dead leaves skittering across a tombstone. "Indeed. A promising one. Ripe with potential."
 
"Potential for what?" Athreos explodes, his voice cracking like a whip. "To disrupt the natural order? To further your own treacherous plots?" He slams the pole into the pebbles, sending tremors through the mist and a jolt through your incorporeal form. "This one, this [[Harvin]]… he is _mine_. My champion. Bound to _me_. And yet, you snatch him from the precipice of death, not once, but _twice_ now."
 
Phenax shrugs, a dismissive ripple in the shadows. "A necessary sacrifice for the grand design, my dear Ferryman. Think of it as… an investment. We all need to make some sacrifices, even the Underking is giving up his granddaughter."
 
The words strike you like a physical blow. _An investment? The Underking's granddaughter?_ "An investment in chaos," Athreos retorts, his voice thick with disgust. "An investment in your own ambition. And what of the cost? What of the souls you toy with, the lives you disrupt?" He steps closer to Phenax, his form looming large, his voice a menacing whisper that cuts through the mist. "Do not think I am blind to your game, Phenax. You and Erebos weave a dangerous web, and I will not be a pawn in it."
 
Phenax's posture changes appearing as if he is going to embrace Athreos while taking a step back into the mist. "Such passion, Athreos. It would be a shame to see it wasted. But worry not, your champion will play his part. I finally have the correct mixture for my seeds with the new inclusion of the devil spawn of the so called Bright Father. And in the end, even you might appreciate the outcome." His voice drips with honeyed poison. "After all, what is a little disruption compared to the chance to reshape the very cosmos?"
 
Athreos falls silent, the mist swirling around him like a shroud of anger and suspicion. You sense his helplessness, his frustration at being caught in a game played by gods. But you also sense a spark of defiance, a refusal to be a mere puppet. He will fight for you, his champion, even if it means defying the gods themselves.  
The weight of their words settles upon you, heavy and cold. You are a Seed, whatever that may mean, a plaything of the gods, your fate entwined with their schemes. But as you watch Athreos stand defiant against the encroaching shadows, a flicker of hope ignites within your spectral form. Perhaps, with the Ferryman's help, you can break free from this cosmic game and forge your own destiny.
