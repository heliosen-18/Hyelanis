    2. I need to warn you about the message, the Sending Service is leaving the city today. Meadowbreeze, your 2nd cousin or something, is the official messenger for [[The Saffron Guard]] up at Demon Watch. The Greenveil is showing signs of failure and apparently there have been reports of things getting through [[The Moss Wall]] from the World Break. There have been strange reports from all over the western parts of [[The Gap]] and the Broadbend Fields of weird phenomenon's and sightings, some as even far south of [[Dunster Downs]] somehow or at least that's what Meadowbreeze told us. The most concerning things is the stuff she couldn't tell us, things only meant for [[the Council of Ten]]'s ears. She was able to warn us though, she said there's a black cloud headed for the [[Black Harbor|Black Harbor]], whatever that means.
