- [[Estrid]]'s dad ([[Raunaeril Xistrith]]) is a bbeg who turned the [[Bog Witch]]. The [[Bog Witch]] was one of his prized possessions but some calamity happened and he erased her memory and had her ditched near Glimhollow, where he abandons all of his failed experiments.
- Raunaeril has sent his LT. [[Achete]] to the The Heirs of Plodno Mausoleum to create an army of undead and attempt to create a pair of Woe Striders.
- **Villain:**You want to know why I killed your mother?I'll tell you why.Because she was a threat to me.She knew too much.She knew about my plans.She knew about my secrets.And she was going to tell the world.So I had to stop her.I had to kill her.It was the only way.I know what you're thinking.You're thinking that I'm a monster.You're thinking that I'm evil.And you're right.I am a monster.I am evil.But I'm not the only one.We're all monsters.We're all evil.It's just that some of us are better at hiding it than others.But I'm not going to hide it anymore.I'm not going to pretend to be something I'm not.I'm a monster.I'm evil.And I'm proud of it.So go ahead and hate me.Go ahead and fear me.But know this:I will never stop.I will never back down.I will never surrender.Until I have achieved my goals.Until I have destroyed everything you hold dear.Until I have made the world a place of darkness and despair.That is my promise to you.And that is my vow.So bring it on.I'm ready for you.
