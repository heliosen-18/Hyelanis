**Persistence**  
**Concept:** The trial tests the wizard's ability to persist against overwhelming odds, not through brute force, but through strategic use of necromancy and cunning tactics.  
**Environment:** A vast, crumbling coliseum with a sandy floor and obsidian walls. The coliseum is open to the sky, and the air shimmers with heat.  
**Challenge:**

1. **Waves of Fire Elementals:** As [[Harvin]] enters the coliseum, he is met with waves of fire elementals (use weaker variants like Small or Medium Fire Elementals). These elementals should be numerous but individually less powerful than a full party would face.
2. **Summoning and Control:** [[Harvin]]'s necromancy abilities come into play here. He can summon undead minions to distract and combat the elementals, allowing him to focus on strategy and spellcasting.
3. **Environmental Hazards:** To further challenge [[Harvin]], incorporate environmental hazards like erupting fire geysers or collapsing sections of the coliseum. [[Harvin]] must use his spells and summoned creatures to navigate these hazards while battling the elementals.
4. **The Persistent Flame:** A single, large fire elemental (or a more powerful creature like a fire giant) acts as the "persistent flame." This creature is resistant to fire damage and has regenerative abilities, symbolizing the persistent nature of fire. [[Harvin]] must devise a strategy to overcome this challenge, perhaps by exploiting a weakness to cold damage or using his necromancy to drain its life force.

**Completion:** [[Harvin]] completes the Persistence trial by defeating the "persistent flame" and surviving the waves of elementals while navigating the environmental hazards.
    
**Impermanence**  
**Concept:** This trial tests [[Harvin]]'s ability to adapt to the ever-changing nature of fire, emphasizing quick thinking, strategic spellcasting, and necromantic manipulation.  
**Environment:** The same 50x50-foot chamber with rough, black obsidian walls, pulsing magma veins, and a steel-grated floor concealing darkness beneath.    
**Challenges:**

1. **Ephemeral Foes:** Instead of salamanders and magma mephits, [[Harvin]] faces a series of fire-themed illusions or spirits that appear and disappear rapidly. These could be ghostly figures wreathed in flame, or even animated bursts of fire that dart around the room. They should be challenging but individually less powerful than the original creatures.
2. **Shifting Floor:** The original challenge of the whistling flames erupting from the grates remains, but with a twist. The pattern of the eruptions becomes more erratic and unpredictable, forcing [[Harvin]] to constantly reassess his positioning and movement. He might need to use spells like _Expeditious Retreat_ or _Misty Step_ to avoid the flames.
3. **Whispers of the Flame:** As [[Harvin]] navigates the room, he hears whispers and voices emanating from the flames. These whispers could be disorienting, taunting, or even offer cryptic clues about the nature of impermanence. This adds a psychological element to the challenge, testing [[Harvin]]'s mental fortitude.
4. **The Unstable Heart:** At the center of the room, a pulsating heart of fire hangs suspended. This heart is the source of the room's instability and the ephemeral foes. [[Harvin]] must find a way to disrupt or destroy the heart, perhaps by using a spell like _Dispel Magic_ or _Magic Missile_ to target its magical essence.

**Completion:** [[Harvin]] completes the Impermanence trial by destroying the unstable heart of fire while surviving the shifting floor and the attacks of the ephemeral foes.
