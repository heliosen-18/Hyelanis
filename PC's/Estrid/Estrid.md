Estrid  
Mother- Katrina (human, witch?, dead when Estrid was infant)  
Biological father- Raunaeril (elf, Ryx-born, did something with vampires?)  
Adoptive father- Viktor (human, War general of Raunaeril, lives unnaturally long life)  
  
This is the story that Viktor told Estrid as she grew up:  
  
Raunaeril and Katerina were in love and together for years. Katrina longed for children and after a while convinces Raunaeril to have a baby. She gets pregnant shortly thereafter. Mid-pregnancy Raunearil starts freaking the fuck out convinced that the baby would challange and kill him eventually. He becomes more and more agitated/ paranoid. Scared, Katrina confides in their trusted war general Viktor and soon they fall in love. Worried for the safety of the unborn child, Viktor and Katrina concoct an escape plan for after the baby is born. After a successful escape they live under the radar out in the boonies(Kingsroy Wilds?) for a year or so before Raunaeril finds them. During their frantic flee, Katrina stalls long enough for Viktor to escape with Estrid, convinced that Viktor was Estrid's best chance at survival. She dies to save them. And Raunaeril is still looking for his missing child, he’ll never stop looking until they’re dead. Dun dun duuuunnn  
  
  
That is the story Estrid currently believes. It could be false…or just from the perspective of Viktor or some variation.  
  
The facts are:           
Raunaeril is real and not really a great person ……lots of fingers in hella pies.  
Estrid has never met Raunaeril, but has memorized his picture  
Viktor definitely raised Estrid by himself  
Estrid is 100% Raunaerils child  
Viktor despises Raunaeril  
Mother probably has some witchy mind magic idk  
  
  
Estrid’s life in human years-  
0 Born in Realms Rest  
0-1 Lived  Kingsroy wilds with Katrina & Viktor  
1.5 mother dies at some point  
2-18 lived in/around Alfoss with Viktor  
        During this time Viktor rigorously trained Estrid. This included survival training in the forest alone, arena battles, several different languages, learning about different factions, etc. All while aiming her at Raunaeril  
18-22 Estrid is out on her own. She doesn't often talk with her adopted father as he taught her not to form attachments.  
23+ She is an urban bounty hunter with a burgeoning business (Cutting Edge Bounty). After moving to Realms Rest she is struggling to make a name for herself.  
  
  
Estrids Personality facts  
-She doesn't like to drink because it slows her reaction time  
-She has no close friends, but there is one other bounty hunter who she works with frequently enough to trust not to die. (Jenson (Changeling/half-elf), warlock? About the age of her dad) Not partner but contact.  
-Thinks of herself as vengeful not evil  
-craves violence but protects the innocent  
-constantly paranoid her biological father will discover her  
  
  
  
Also, there's a thing with her blood kinda being a beacon, so she's super aware when she bleeds, so that could be a thing. She has to, like, burn it or something.
