Harvin Holst Lived fairly well as a child in Neverwinter. When he became of age he joined Neverwinter's Navy. He met a half-elf named Frigga. They left the navy to start a family. Harvin found new work at the city's mage guild after learning he had magical talent. His talent didn't extend beyond the simplest of magic and he eventually became an administrator of the guild. Years had passed and they had a daughter named Penelope. They took her out sailing with a small boat they had purchased. However one of their trips had gone badly. An unexpected storm destroyed their boat and Harvin was not able to save his family. He was rescued after a short time. Harvin went into mourning. Two years later, Harvin was becoming desperate. He had been suspended from the guild for searching out forbidden magics and ancient evils. During this time, his magical abilities had started to grow, though he was unsure as of why. He put the thought aside when he heard rumors circulating about a fabled horror. The [[Book of the Dead]]. Harvin knew what he had to do.
