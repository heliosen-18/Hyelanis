Stat block: Deathlock Mastermind
 
Achete was born in a small village in the middle of nowhere. She was always a strange child, with a fascination for the dark and the macabre. She was also gifted with a natural talent for magic.
 
When Achete was 16 years old, she was attacked by a vampire. She was bitten and turned into an undead creature. Achete was horrified by her new existence, but she quickly learned to use her newfound powers to her advantage.
 
Achete traveled the world, learning more about magic and her own abilities. She eventually came to the attention of Raunaeril, a powerful master vampire. Raunaeril was impressed by Achete's power and offered her a place in his service.
 
Achete accepted Raunaeril's offer, and she has been serving him ever since. She is one of his most trusted lieutenants, and she is often sent on dangerous missions. Achete is a skilled warrior and a powerful sorceress, and she is feared by her enemies.
 
However, Achete is not without her own doubts and misgivings. She is still haunted by the memories of her human life, and she sometimes questions her decision to serve Raunaeril. But she knows that she is too powerful to be left to her own devices, and she believes that she can do more good by serving Raunaeril than she could by trying to fight him.
 
Achete is a complex and conflicted character. She is a powerful sorceress, a skilled warrior, and a loyal servant. But she is also a haunted soul who is struggling to find her place in the world.
