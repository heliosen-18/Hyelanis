**Assistant Headmaster of The [[Black Harbor|Black Harbor]] Academy**
 
Spiv Fastboot was born into a humble halfling family in the outskirts of [[Black Harbor|Black Harbor]], a bustling port city in the heart of a predominantly human kingdom. From a young age, Spiv displayed a natural curiosity and a mischievous spirit, often finding himself in the middle of playful adventures with the other halfling children.
 
One fateful day, while wandering through the city's crowded market, Spiv stumbled upon the impressive facade of the Order of the Two Moon, a prestigious mage's guild that stood as a bastion of magical knowledge in the city. Fascinated by the arcane wonders within, he began to spend every free moment observing the mages and wizards as they practiced their craft. The grand hall, filled with levitating books and shimmering lights, sparked a flame of aspiration within Spiv's heart.
 
Despite the skepticism and doubt from his family and some of the guild members, Spiv's determination to prove his magical potential knew no bounds. He set out to convince the Guildmaster Sorin Lockreach, to give him a chance. With relentless tenacity and a handful of small magical tricks up his sleeve, Spiv finally managed to impress Archibald and secured an apprenticeship at the Order of the Two Moon.
 
Over the years, Spiv's natural talent for magic and his unique halfling perspective set him apart from the other mages. He excelled at manipulating illusions, misdirection, and stealth spells – skills particularly valued in the diverse and bustling port city where humans dominated. His ability to move unnoticed among the taller folk and his cheerful demeanor endeared him to many in [[Black Harbor|Black Harbor]].
 
During his training at the guild, Spiv grew close to a human mage named [[Harvin]] Holst, who saw potential beyond his stature. [[Harvin]] became his mentor, and together they forged a powerful bond. The duo quickly gained a reputation for their combined magical prowess and playful antics throughout the city.
 
As time passed, Spiv evolved into a skilled and respected mage within the Order of the Two Moon. He became known for his helpful nature, always assisting those in need with a friendly grin and a helpful spell. In the midst of his magical journey, Spiv also discovered a talent for enchanting, imbuing mundane items with subtle magical properties.
 
Today, Spiv Fastboot stands as a testament to the Order's open-mindedness, embracing diversity and recognizing that magic knows no bounds, be it in the form of a towering human or a sprightly halfling. His adventurous spirit and dedication to the magical arts continue to shape the mage's guild in [[Black Harbor|Black Harbor]], and he serves as an inspiration for aspiring halfling mages throughout the kingdom.
