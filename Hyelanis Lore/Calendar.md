| **Nyx**    | The Great Moon (Realm of the Gods) | **32 Days** (1 Month) | Defines the month length and the **Heliark** (Day 1) rest day, where its four major phases (New, Full, Quarters) _always_ align. | The primary source of divine and celestial power; the visible realm of the gods.            |
| **Lampas** | The Guard Moon (Moonlet)           | **8 Days** (1 Week)   | Defines the **8-day week** length and is perfectly synchronized with Nyx, as its phases also fall on **Heliark**.                | The "Torchbearer" or "Attendant Light" to Nyx, providing a visible, sub-weekly time marker. |

This system creates a calendar deeply tied to the heavens, with both the primary moon and its satellite constantly reinforcing the most sacred day of the week, **Heliark**.
