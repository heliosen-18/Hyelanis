# The Material Plane
Made of many planets surrounded by a void called Wildspace. Wildspace exists in both the Astral Plane and the Material Plane, making it a viable way to both travel to other planets in the Material Plane as well as the Outer Planes.

# Echos of the Material Plane

#### [The Feywild](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Feywild)
The embodiment and reflection of emotions and nature that seeps in from the Material Plane. Many places mirror that of the Material Plane but are much more chaotic and natural.
#### [The Shadowfell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Shadowfell)
The embodiment and reflection of despair and darkness that seeps in from the Material Plane. Many places mirror that of the Material Plane but are much more twisted and devoid of living and colors.

# Border Planes

#### [The Ethereal Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#EtherealPlane)
It overlaps and connects the Material Plane and the inner planes. The Border Ethereal is the location of where the Ethereal Plane perfectly overlaps each plane, whereas the Deep Ethereal is the space between the planes is devoid of all matter besides the never-ending thick mist.
#### [The Astral Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#AstralPlane)
A plane filled with a vast emptiness with small collections matter spread through. One has to travel through the Astral Plane in order to reach the Outer planes from the Inner planes and the Material Plane.
#### [[The River Aethos]]
Not exactly an entire realm but the [[River Atheos]] connects to all of the evil-aligned planes, also known as the Lower Planes. When a mortal dies and they are not claimed by another god they appear first at the banks of the River Aethos and from there The Ferryman (Atheros), or one of his lesser ferrymen, takes them to where they ought to be. 
#### [[The River Lumina]]
Similar to [[The River Aethos]] but [[The River Lumina]] connects all of the good-aligned planes together.
