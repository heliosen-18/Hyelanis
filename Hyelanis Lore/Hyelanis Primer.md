The continent of [[Hyelanis]] is on the world of [[Soothrin]], which has a large white moon that orbits it called Nyx and a smaller dark blue moon that orbits Nyx called Lampas.  
The continent of [[Hyelanis]] is a single empire. This empire is broken up into 8 separate kingdoms, where the ruler of the kingdom swears allegiance to the Emperor.
 
The 8 kingdoms are:

- [[Bastion Reach]] – The largest and most populous of all the Kingdoms and also contains the city of Realm's Rest, the city where the Emperor resides and the capital city of the empire. This kingdom is ruled by Humans but has the biggest mixture of races throughout the Empire.
- [[The Northern Abyss]] – The northern most kingdom of the Empire and is ruled by half-giants. It is known to be rich in earthen resources, but hard to survive in. Currently undergoing an everlasting winter that is wreaking havoc on the citizens and the ecosystem.
- [[O'Thalas]] – This kingdom is ruled only by full-blood Elfs, known as Truesingers. Only a few cities exist in this kingdom, but they are almost entirely populated by the Truesingers. Many small communities are established throughout the kingdom that half-blood elfs, known as Grimveins, and other races live in and provide supplies to the larger Truesinger cities.
- [[Xabarín Wildlands]] – This kingdom is ruled by two courts made up of a variety of races. Many Centaurs, Changelings, Fairies, Firbolgs, Rabbitfolk, and Satyrs call the Bedheim woods home whereas Lizardfolk, bugbears, hobgoblins, and goblins reside in the Trowe Bog. This kingdom is the least developed and most natural of all the kingdoms.
- [[Vala Mere]] – This kingdom is ruled and primarily populated by the dragonkiin races. It is currently undergoing a civil war between the ruling cast of Chromads and the worker cast of the Metallics.
- [[Finehold]] – This kingdom is a diarchy of two separate monarchs, one is dwarfish and the other gnomish. This kingdom is predominately populated above ground by gnomes whereas the dwarves reside in the mountains and underground. Other races that reside in this kingdom are predominately found only in above ground communites.
- [[Zargon Wastes]] – This kingdom is ruled by whoever is the strongest military leader, currently an Orc. You can find most of the monstrous races in this kingdom like Orcs, Birdfolk, Gnolls, Leonins, Loxodons, Minotaurs, and Shifters. This kingdom is the least civilized of all the kingdoms and is consistently beset upon by chaos as the strongest are always vying to move up into higher positions of authority.
- [[The Boiling Flats]] – This kingdom is ruled by Halflings. Most of the population of this kingdom are nomads and always moving around the large desert that mostly takes up the entire kingdom. You can find many different races in this kingdom, but the infrastructure is based on halfling size proportions in many of the cities.

So we'll be starting in the kingdom of [[The Northern Abyss]] in an area called Dekapolis, a small collection of ten villages that is isolated from the rest of the northern kingdom. [[The Northern Abyss]] is primarily ruled by half-giants and they make up most of the population, except in Dekapolis which is a mishmash of many different races. You have heard about the everlasting winter that is causing a lot of problems for the people of the area, and there are many mysterious that lurk in this sparsely populated kingdom, leading to any number of different reasons for why you would have travelled to Dekapolis from wherever you my call home, maybe you just want to start a new life far from anything you've ever known.
