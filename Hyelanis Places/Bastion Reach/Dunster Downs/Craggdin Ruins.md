Harpy base  
(Ahnko, hakno, jhamp)
 
The overgrown ruins of a stone fortress amidst a decaying fen. The air is filled with a sulphurous odor.
 
This square keep has strong stone walls with wooden hoarding. It appears deserted, but is inhabited by a flock of harpy's led by a boss named Velinis. The keep has been damaged by an earthquake, and its walls are broken.
 
When song becomes silence and the Steel Cup lies in blood, the Throne of Storms shall be destroyed  
The Dominion of Coins shall be sundered when the rivers run red with blood  
The Wand of Spells shall be found when the sun is eclipsed by the Chariot and sea becomes sky
