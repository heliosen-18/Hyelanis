**Room 2 Hallway:**
 
As the party walks down the hallway, they hear a faint clicking sound coming from the walls.
 
Suddenly, the torches go out, plunging the hallway into darkness.
 
The party is now in complete darkness. They can hear the clicking sound getting louder.
 
Suddenly, a series of blades spring out of the walls, blocking the party's path.
 
The party must now find a way to disable the trap or find another way around it.
 
Here are some ways the party can disable the trap:
 
A successful Perception check (DC 15) reveals a small hole in the wall near the ceiling. A character who can fit through the hole can reach a lever that will disable the trap.
 
A successful Investigation check (DC 15) reveals a hidden compartment in one of the walls. Inside the compartment is a scroll of dispel magic. A character who casts the dispel magic spell on the trap will disable it.
 
The party can find another way around the trap. There is a small door in the wall on the left side of the hallway. The door leads to a side chamber.
 
If the party is unable to disable the trap, they will be forced to fight their way through the blades. The blades deal 1d6 slashing damage per round.
   

**Room3 Chapel:**
 
The party notices that the snake's 4 fangs are made of different gemstones. The gemstones are different colors: red, green, orange, and white.
 
The party also notices that there are four pedestals in the room. Each pedestal has a different symbol on it: a sun, a raindrop, a leaf, and a moon.
 
**Room 4 The Vault Hallway**
   

The party enters a large room with a vault door at the far end. The door is made of solid gold and is covered in intricate carvings. One the wall across from the door has words inscribed on it.
 
_In the land of the lost,_  
_Where the sun never shines,_  
_There is a treasure chest_  
_That is guarded by three wise._
 
_The first wise one is strong,_  
_The second wise one is quick,_  
_The third wise one is clever._
 
_To open the treasure chest,_  
_You must defeat the three wise._
 
_But beware,_  
_For if you fail,_  
_You will be cursed for all eternity._
 
The first wise one is strong. This could refer to a creature that is physically strong, such as a dragon or a giant.  
The second wise one is quick. This could refer to a creature that is fast, such as a cheetah or a unicorn.  
The third wise one is clever. This could refer to a creature that is intelligent, such as a wizard or a sorcerer.

Fear not [[Harvin]] Holst, it is not your time to join me yet, you still have many things that need doing. One mote of inspiration I can provide is that Frigga and Penelope are still within you grasp. I put my faith into you my child of the scythe, and remember a deal is a deal, the book is yours to find, but as with all things in life and death, there must be an equivalent exchange. Now I shall ferry you to a place more befitting of your task. But. You must. Find. Me. My. Book.
