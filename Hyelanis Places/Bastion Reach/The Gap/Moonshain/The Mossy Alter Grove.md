Description: Nestled amidst the lush foliage and cascading waters of the Falls from Nowhere, the Mossy Alter Grove is a tranquil sanctuary that exudes an aura of reverence and mystique. Enveloped by towering trees and verdant vegetation, the grove is a secluded haven where the natural world and the divine intersect. At its center stands a weathered stone altar, adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes of the hunt and the ebb and flow of the tides. Surrounding the altar, a canopy of emerald leaves filters sunlight, casting dappled shadows upon the moss-covered ground below. The air is filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers and the soothing sound of water cascading down from the Falls from Nowhere, creating a serene atmosphere conducive to reflection and meditation.
 
Lore: The Mossy Alter Grove holds deep spiritual significance for the people of [[Moonshain]], serving as a sacred place of worship and communion with the divine. It is dedicated to two powerful goddesses revered by the townsfolk: the Wild Huntress, goddess of nature and the hunt, and the Quiet Siren, goddess of the sea and knowledge. According to ancient legends, it is said that the Falls from Nowhere is the point where the domains of these two deities converge, creating a nexus of natural energy and divine power.  
The Wild Huntress is worshipped by hunters, rangers, and those who seek to live in harmony with the natural world. Her presence is felt in the rustle of leaves, the call of wild animals, and the whisper of the wind through the trees. Followers of the Wild Huntress come to the Sacred Grove and Altar to offer prayers and offerings in gratitude for the bounty of the land and the protection of the hunt.  
The Quiet Siren, on the other hand, is revered by scholars, sailors, and seekers of knowledge. Her wisdom is said to be as vast as the ocean depths, and her voice can be heard in the crash of waves and the murmurs of the tide. Those who seek enlightenment and guidance come to the Sacred Grove and Altar to seek the Quiet Siren's blessings and to meditate upon the mysteries of the sea and the cosmos.  
Together, the Wild Huntress and the Quiet Siren embody the balance and harmony of nature, guiding the people of [[Moonshain]] in their quest for wisdom, enlightenment, and spiritual fulfillment. The Sacred Grove and Altar stands as a testament to their divine presence and a beacon of hope and solace for all who seek solace and guidance in the heart of the wilderness.
