**Windmere: A Village in the Shadow of the Midnight Edge**  
**Geography and Atmosphere:**

- **Location:** Nestled in a valley at the base of the Midnight Edge, the mountains act as a natural barrier and backdrop for the town.
- **Architecture:** The buildings are a blend of sturdy stone (taken from the mountains) and wood. Some structures incorporate the natural curves of the mountainside. A few homes built higher up the slope are accessible via carved-out paths and bridges.
- **Climate:** The weather is generally temperate, but the proximity to the Midnight Edge means that Windmere experiences cooler evenings and occasional mountain winds.
- **Ambience:** There's a sense of both coziness and adventure in Windmere. The townsfolk are hardy and self-sufficient, yet welcoming to outsiders. The distant silhouette of [[The Moss Wall]] and the knowledge of the World Break beyond lend a subtle air of mystery and tension to the everyday life.
