## The Great Work: Rejection of the Terminus

Lichdom is the cessation of the cycle and the absolute mastery over the soul's passage. It is not a natural undead state like the **Revenant** or the **Specter**, but a deliberate, focused act of **Self-Transgression**, where the Necromancer sacrifices the feeble **Chassis Mortal** for a state of eternal, unholy power. This process is known among initiates as **The Great Work**.

The goal of the ritual is simple: to forcibly excise the complete **Animus** from the body and bind it to an external, inert vessel, the **Phylactery**, granting the Lich immortality against all but the most concerted annihilation.

## I. The Preparation of the Aetheric Vault

The **Phylactery** is the core of the Lich's existence, the **Aetheric Vault** in which the soul resides. It is not merely a container; it is a point of constant, agonizing pressure, holding the entire soul in a state of suspended agony, preventing its natural return to the **Terminus**.

### 1. The Chosen Vessel

The vessel itself must possess inherent value and integrity, resisting both physical decay and arcane disruption.

- **Materiality:** Only materials of supreme density and metaphysical resistance are suitable: a shard of pure, black **Obsidian** taken from a volcanic vent, a **Diamond** of flawless clarity (no less than 50 carats), or the fossilized **Eye of a Leviathan**.

- **Insulation:** The vessel must be sealed against accidental psychic bleed. It must be wrapped in the _flayed skin of a martyr_ (a creature of true, selfless purity) and encased in lead mixed with pulverized **Grave-Dust** to absorb and nullify external interference.

- **Consecration:** The vessel must be consecrated in an unholy font for precisely forty days and forty nights, submerged in a continuously replaced mixture of quicksilver, holy water (to corrupt), and the _blood of a lawful innocent_ (to bind). This process twists the vessel into a true **Soul-Trap**.

### 2. The Elixir of Perpetual Night

This is the final draught, a toxic concentration of death energy used to shock the soul out of the body at the moment of the ritual's climax.

**Ingredients (The Vile Brew):**

- **Distilled Anguish:** The tears of a creature experiencing profound, existential terror, collected in a lead thimble.

- **The Mute Hand:** The severed hand of a master thief, taken within an hour of death, symbolizing the stealing of life.

- **Aetheric Residue:** A measure of the pulverized heart of a minor elemental spirit, dissolved in a base of _acidic bile_ from a fiend.

- **The Final Touch:** The entire mixture is then boiled in the blood of a close, trusted friend, ensuring the last memory tasted by the body is **Betrayal**.

## II. The Rite of Soul Transference (Ascension)

The ritual must take place at the precise moment of a **Solar Eclipse** or a similar planetary alignment that casts a veil of true darkness upon the earth, symbolizing the momentary failure of the divine.

1. **Preparation of the Chassis:** The Necromancer carves the **Runes of Annihilation** (typically Rune- Mors and Rune- Nihil) across their own chest and forehead using the edge of the prepared **Phylactery**. The runes must penetrate the skin to the bone.

2. **The Chant of Severance:** The Necromancer begins the continuous, accelerating recitation of the **Chant of Severance**, forcing their will to recognize the **Phylactery** as the true seat of the **Animus**.

3. **The Moment of Annihilation:** Upon reaching the climax of the chant, the Necromancer consumes the entire **Elixir of Perpetual Night**. The poison's effect is instantaneous and excruciating, initiating the separation of soul from flesh. The body will die rapidly, violently, and in extreme agony.

4. **The Soul-Binding:** In the milliseconds between the body's death and the soul's release to the **Terminus**, the Necromancer's forced will must complete the transference. The **Animus** is pulled from the decaying body and slammed into the **Phylactery**.

If successful, the **Chassis Mortal** collapses, and the spirit is permanently bound. If the will falters, the soul is destroyed by the Elixir's caustic nature, resulting in total and absolute **Annihilation**.

## III. The Eternal Obligation (Soul-Feed)

The resulting undead form (the Lich) is indestructible save for the destruction of the **Phylactery**. However, the **Phylactery** is not self-sustaining. It must be continually fed.

The Lich's soul, held in suspension, slowly but inexorably degrades and is consumed by the very Necromantic energy of the binding spell. To prevent this decay and the eventual destruction of the Lich (true **Annihilation**), the Lich must regularly sacrifice intelligent, living souls.

- **The Sustenance:** The energy released by the sacrifice of a soul is captured and channeled directly into the **Phylactery**. This act stabilizes the Lich's essence.

- **The Demand:** The frequency of the **Soul-Feed** is dependent on the complexity and power of the Lich's magic. A passive Lich may require a sacrifice once per season; a Lich actively wielding powerful spells and rituals may require daily sustenance.

- **The Consequence:** Should the **Phylactery** go without a soul-feed for too long, the Lich's form begins to decay at an accelerated rate, their power wanes, and they face the inevitable, irreversible obliteration of their **Animus**. The Lich is thus eternally enslaved to the ritual that granted them freedom from death.
