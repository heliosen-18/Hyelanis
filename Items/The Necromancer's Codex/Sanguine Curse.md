This is what you'd know from reading:
 
Vampires are spawned into the world when a mortal contracts the Sanguine Curse, dies, and is reborn undead. There are a variety of ways to contract the curse. A vampire may have offered their blood to a loyal servant, powerful ally, or a loved one they wished to elevate. Doing it this way typically creates a stronger more in-control vampire. More commonly, however, a vampire may have bitten you, and you survived the vampire's attack long enough to contract the Sanguine Curse before perishing and being reborn. Other methods include ancient and dark magics, deals with the Erebos The Underking, or cursed magical artifacts. (A ritual to become a vampire is outlined in your Libram) Regardless of how you become a vampire you know the curse progresses through 4 distinct stages or levels. Those only bitten rarely progress past the 2nd level while those cursed by other means are generally make to the 3rd or 4th level, becoming a vampiric paradigm.
 
*The Veil's Embrace - A Ritual of Eternal Night*
 
**Preparation:**
 
1. Choose a night of a double new moon of both Nyx and Kerberos when the veil between the worlds is thinnest.
2. Find a secluded location, preferably a dense forest or an ancient cemetery, where the energies of the earth converge.
3. Gather the following materials:
    - A silver chalice filled with a mixture of blood-red wine and your own blood.
    - A ceremonial dagger, silver if possible.
    - Black candles to be arranged in a circle.
    - A crescent moon superimposed upon a full moon drawn on the ground with powdered silver or chalk.
    - A vial of pure black sand from the northern beaches of the World Break.
      
    
 
**The Ritual:**
 
As the midnight hour approaches, stand within the circle of candles, facing the moon drawings, and meditate upon your deepest desires for immortality and power.
 
Light the candles one by one, invoking the spirits of the night to witness your transformation.
 
With the ceremonial dagger, make a small incision on your wrist, allowing a few drops of your blood to fill the chalice of wine.
 
Drink from the chalice, symbolically merging your essence with the blood of the night.
 
Sprinkle the black sand over your body, feeling its dark energy envelop you.
 
Recite the incantation:
 
"By the darkness of the Underking,  
I call upon your powers that be.  
Grant me the gift of eternal night,  
Make me one with the shadows,  
A creature of the dark,  
A child of the moon,  
A vampire."
 
Await in silence, feeling the energies of the ritual swirling around you, binding you to the forces of darkness.
 
When you sense the transformation is complete, extinguish the candles and leave the ceremonial space, knowing that you have crossed the threshold into a new existence.
