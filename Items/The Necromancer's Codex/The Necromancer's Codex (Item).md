_Wondrous item, artifact_

This ancient tome is bound in black leather with pages inscribed in pulsing, sinister runes. To unlock the powers within, a practitioner must study the dark arts described in each chapter.

#### **Chapter 1: The Gateway to the Abyss**

- **Abyssal Spark:** You learn the _Spare the Dying_ cantrip. When you cast it, the range is 30 feet instead of touch.
- **Opened Gateway:** You can cast _Detect Evil and Good_ (detecting only undead, spirits, and entities of the Abyss) at will without expending a spell slot or material components.

#### **Chapter 2: The Anatomy of Death**

- **Metaphysical Insight:** You gain proficiency in the Medicine and Religion skills. If you are already proficient, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks made with those skills.
- **Shadowed Veil:** You pass through the veil with resilience; you have advantage on death saving throws.

#### **Chapter 3: Rites of Reanimation**

- **Ossuary Command:** When you cast _Animate Dead_, the Skeletons or Zombies created gain a bonus to their AC and saving throws equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down).
- **The Great Transgression:** You can cast _Animate Dead_ once per long rest without expending a spell slot.

#### **Chapter 4: The Binding of Spirits**

- **Circle of Binding:** You can cast _Magic Circle_ once per long rest without expending a spell slot or material components. When cast in this way, the spell can only affect celestials, fiends, and undead.
- **Spectral Subjugation:** As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands for 1 hour, or until you or your allies harm it. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### **Chapter 5: Necrotic Alchemy**

- **Elixir of Life Extension:** This potion harnesses necrotic energy to slow the aging process, granting the imbiber extended years of life. However, it comes at a cost, as the necromancer must continuously replenish the potion's power with fresh necrotic energy.
- **Potion of Invulnerability:** This potent brew temporarily renders the drinker immune to physical harm, allowing them to shrug off blows that would normally prove fatal. However, its effects are fleeting, and overuse can lead to a dangerous dependency on the potion's power.
- **Poison of the Black Lotus:** This deadly concoction is crafted from the essence of the rare and elusive black lotus flower, infused with concentrated necrotic energy. A single drop can induce agonizing pain and swift death, making it a favored tool of assassins and those who seek to eliminate their enemies discreetly.
- **Potion of Spectral Sight** allows the user to perceive the ethereal plane and see through illusions, but it can also be overwhelming and disorienting.
- **Elixir of Necromantic Empowerment** grants a temporary surge of necrotic power, enhancing the necromancer's spells and abilities. However, this power comes at a cost, potentially corrupting the soul and creating a dangerous dependency.

#### **Chapter 6: The Lich's Ascension**

- **Aetheric Vault:** You can cast _Soul Cage_ once per week without expending a spell slot. The _Necromancer's Codex_ itself serves as the material component and the vault where the soul is stored. The spell duration is extended, lasting until you have exploited the soul for a sixth time.
- **Eternal Obligation:** To maintain the benefits of Chapter 6, you must "feed" a soul into the book once per month. If you fail to do so, all benefits from the Codex are suppressed until a soul is sacrificed.
