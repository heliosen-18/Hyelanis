# The Great Transgression

The act of reanimation is the central pillar of Necromancy, the true **Transgression** against the natural order and the laws dictated by the divine. It is the practice of seizing the vacant **Chassis**—the body—and forcing a substitute **Animus**—a phantom of will, often supplied by the Necromancer or a lesser elemental spirit—to inhabit it.

The efficacy of the Rite is determined by two critical factors: the integrity of the **Chassis** and the **Subjugation** of the binding forces. A novice Necromancer may fumble, achieving only a transient, shambling automaton. A master, however, can impart a shadow of cunning and purpose, creating an undying servant bound by the strongest **Ligatures of the Will**.

## I. The Corpse Puppet: Foundations of Servitude

The fundamental forms of the undead, the corpse puppets, require minimal investment of arcane power and are the first mastery a student must achieve. They are, essentially, vessels of raw, compelled motion.

### 1. The Ossuary Command (Skeletons)

The simplest and most durable form of reanimation involves the manipulation of bone. Bone, being calcified mineral, holds arcane energy with greater stability and less decay than flesh. The ritual for raising a **Skeleton** requires only the **Ossuary Command**, a sustained mental projection of _obedience_ and _form_.

**The Process:**

- **Chassis Preparation:** The remains must be clean, dry, and structurally sound.

- **Rune Placement:** Inscribe the **Runes of Binding and Subjugation** (typically [[Rune- Malthus]]) directly onto the forehead, ribcage, and the joints of the elbows and knees using a stylus dipped in a mixture of powdered bone and quicksilver.

- **The Chant:** Recite the **Command** in the tongue of the dead, focusing the will until the skeletal structure begins to rattle and assemble itself. The resulting servant is swift, weak against blunt force, but tireless.


### 2. The Putrescent Awakening (Zombies)

Raising the fleshy remains is a more _abhorrent_ yet potent practice. The **Zombie** possesses greater strength and resilience but is plagued by the curse of rapid decay. The primary focus of this ritual is to preserve the **Ligature** before the body's internal humors dissipate.

**The Process:**

- **Aetheric Seal:** Before the Rite, the Necromancer must cast a minor preservation spell, sealing the major orifices with dried **Moribund Dust** (a mixture of crushed liver and graveyard earth) to slow the exit of vital fluids.

- **Binding:** The spell must utilize the remnants of the subject’s own nervous system, forcing it to mimic life. The process is often accompanied by a foul green or black glow, indicating the low-grade spirit being forced into the vacant **Chassis**.

- **Command Efficacy:** The command structure imparted to a zombie must be simple (e.g., _Guard_, _Attack_, _Haul_). Complex tasks lead to confusion and inevitable self-destruction or lapse into uncontrolled rage.


## II. The Ligature of the Will: Advanced Binding

The difference between a transient puppet and a true, potent minion lies in the quality of the binding—the **Ligature**.

A master does not merely fill the shell; he grafts a piece of his own **Animus**—or a highly structured external spirit—to the dead flesh.

|Method|Puppet Type|Binding Source|Efficacy|Risk|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Simple Compulsion**|Skeleton, Zombie|Necromancer's momentary focus|Low (Transient/Dull)|Low|
|**Focused Graft**|Ghoul, Crypt-Walker|Minor Earth Elemental/Bound Wraith|Medium (Specific Task-Oriented)|Moderate (Loss of control)|
|**The Grand Rebirth**|**Revenant**|Fragment of the Original Soul/Major Spirit|High (Semi-sentient/Loyal)|High (Catastrophic failure)|

### Reanimation Runes

For all advanced forms, the following Runes must be etched upon a focus object (a bone pendant, or the subject's breastplate) and kept within the Necromancer's possession:

- **Rune of Persistence (Zelot):** Ensures the **Chassis** holds its form despite decay or damage.

- **Rune of Compliance (Kael):** Overrides the instinctual desire of the dead to return to the terminus.

- **Rune of Reflex (Xanthos):** Allows for rapid thought and complex motor tasks (essential for Revenants).


## III. The Revenant and the Terminus

The **Revenant** is the apex of reanimation magic. It is a creature that crosses the boundary of simple servitude, possessing a shadow of its former intellect, bound by an unwavering purpose, typically **Vengeance** or **Eternal Guarding**.

The ritual is dangerous, as it involves drawing a **Fragment of the Original Soul**—a splinter of residual _will_ and _memory_—back across the terminus and fusing it with the animated **Chassis**. This fragment is not the whole soul, but a powerful echo.

### The Rite of Soul Splintering

1. **Preparation:** The body must be preserved and intact, ideally having been dead for no more than a lunar cycle.

2. **The Nexus:** The Necromancer must establish a connection point (the **Nexus**) between the living plane and the terminus. This often involves a living sacrifice whose final breath provides the energetic conduit.

3. **The Draw:** Using the victim's name and a powerful artifact (such as their skull or a piece of their bone), the Necromancer compels the splintered **Animus** to return.

4. **Implantation:** The returned fragment is not secured by a simple external spell but must be implanted into the subject's heart or mind. This creates a deeply powerful, yet _unstable_, servant. Should the original will overpower the binding **Ligature**, the Necromancer faces a self-aware, highly capable enemy.


This advanced practice demands total focus and a preparedness to destroy one's own creation should the **Revenant** show signs of self-determination. The risks are often worth the reward, for a Revenant serves with the fury and skill it possessed in life, amplified by the cold resilience of the dead.

## IV. The Whole Soul: The Rite of Corpus Resurgens

The highest ambition of the Necromancer is not mere servitude, but the absolute reversal of the **Terminus**. This is the Rite of **Corpus Resurgens**, the process of recalling the entirety of a departed **Animus** and forcing its occupation of a new, available **Chassis**. This ritual is functionally true resurrection, yet achieved through absolute coercion rather than divine grace.

This Rite is seldom attempted, as failure results in the permanent annihilation of the soul and the uncontrolled creation of a powerful **Abomination** from the unstable energy.

### The Required Components

The difficulty of this Rite is compounded by the rarity and abhorrent nature of the catalysts:

1. **The New Chassis:** A host body, ideally healthy, recently deceased (less than 48 hours), and of a compatible form. The Necromancer must meticulously cleanse it of its former occupant's residual **Animus** using repeated applications of concentrated **Sepulchral Salt**.

2. **The Soul Anchor:** An object that holds a _powerful_ emotional or psychic link to the departed soul. This is not just a keepsake, but a focus saturated with the subject's memory—a **Locket of Vows**, a petrified piece of their _First-Born Tooth_, or a shard of their own tombstone are examples.

3. **Phylactery Blood (The Medium):** A vessel containing the life-force of a sentient creature that has been willingly—or forcefully—blended with stabilized Necromantic energy. This functions as the medium through which the summoned soul can cross the Threshold. The volume must be measured precisely to the psychic mass of the target soul.
	- **Composition:** This is a volatile suspension. It requires the arterial blood of a creature of purity (e.g., a unicorn or first-born child) to be forcefully mixed with finely ground **Soul-Ash** (the residue of a destroyed minor fiend or demon) and preserved with an unstable dose of **Quicksilver of the Grave** to stabilize the aetheric charge. It acts as the dimensional bridge.

4. **The Voice of Compulsion:** The Rite requires the continuous, unwavering chant of the **Grand Summons**, which must include the subject’s _True Name_ and _Lineage_, uttered by three living acolytes whose lives are bound to the Necromancer's own will.

5. **The Vital Spark (Aetheric Viscera):** A single, freshly harvested organ or extract from a creature of immense and primal life-force—such as the **Beating Heart of a Dragon Turtle** or the **Spinal Fluid of an Adult Dragon**. This component provides the immediate, overwhelming burst of raw life-energy necessary to override the deep biological stasis of death and force the **New Chassis** to accept the final fusion.

### The Transposition

The ritual culminates in the **Transposition**—the moment the full **Animus** crosses the divide. The Necromancer acts as the singular point of focus, drawing the soul across the **Nexus** established by the **Phylactery Blood**.

The **Animus** is presented with the **New Chassis**. The resulting outcome is wholly dependent on the soul's ability or willingness to accept the new form.

- **Success:** The soul accepts the **Chassis**, and the subject returns to life, fully intact, yet often suffering from profound, existential confusion and psychic fatigue.

- **Failure:** The soul rejects the forced binding. The psychic energy of the summoned soul combines with the volatile **Phylactery Blood**, resulting in a cataclysmic discharge. This discharge either destroys the **New Chassis** entirely or fuses it into a monstrous, uncontrolled **Flesh Abomination**, whose strength is equal to the sum of the soul's anguish.
