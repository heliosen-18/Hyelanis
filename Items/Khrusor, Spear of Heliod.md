*Weapon (spear), artifact (requires attunement)*

Heliod wields _Khrusor,_ a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it’s typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.

_**Spear of the Sun.**_ This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

_**Blessing of the Sun.**_ If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

**Piety 3+.** You gain 15 temporary hit points each dawn.

**Piety 10+.** The spear gains beneficial property #1.

**Piety 25+.** The spear gains beneficial properties #2 & 3.

**Piety 50+.** The spear gains beneficial property #4.

**If you aren’t a worshiper of Heliod,** the spear has the 2 listed detrimental properties.

_**Luminous.**_ The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.

_**Sun’s Retaliation.**_ When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can’t be used again until the next dawn.

_**Spells.**_ The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [guiding bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2133-guiding-bolt) (1 charge), [daylight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2060-daylight) (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), [sunbeam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2270-sunbeam) (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn.

_**Destroying the Spear.**_ If taken to Erebos’s palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, _Khrusor_ is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos’s service.

Proficiency with a Spear allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

## Beneifical Properties
1. While attuned to Khrusor, Khrusor gains the **Thrown** property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 300 feet. When you make a ranged attack with Khrusor, the spear magically flies back to your hand immediately after the attack, whether you hit or miss.
2. While attuned to Khrusor, you have Resistance to Radiant damage.
3. While attuned to Khrusor, your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 24.
4. **Solar Mastery.** When you damage a creature with Khrusor, the target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage, and its body is scorched by divine heat. Until the end of your next turn, any fire damage or radiant damage dealt to that creature by any source is increased by 1d4. Additionally, the extra radiant damage dealt by the spear ignores all of the target's **damage resistance** to radiant damage.
## Detrimental Properties
- While attuned to Khrusor, you cannot gain any of the benefits of a **short or long rest** if you are currently in an area of **bright light that is sunlight**, including the bright light shed by the spear itself. To successfully complete a rest, you must find an area of dim light, darkness, or shade.
- The wielder of Khrusor subconsciously carries Heliod's resentment and superiority toward other gods. Whenever you are within 60 feet of a devout follower, holy symbol, or holy site dedicated to a god other than Heliod, you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are **compelled to speak dismissively** of that god and their worshipers, asserting Heliod's superiority. Furthermore, you automatically fail any saving throws or ability checks to resist spells or effects cast by a creature that openly worships a god other than Heliod.
