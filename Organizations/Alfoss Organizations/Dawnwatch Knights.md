Dawnwatch Knights- random office building DMV-esque

Merciful aid on the edge of the sword. Powerful and disciplined, Dawnwatch Knights is a nation-wide organization which consists of elite warriors and scholars. Each major city has its own Chapter.  Members of the sect are called knights. When asked, the knights state their mission as simply “Protection of mankind.” The knights are lethal, honorable, and unfortunately, convinced that they are always right

- [[Estrid]] has also been part of Dawnwatch , although they left on bad terms. Also knows the players and has a single contact left in the Knights.
- Amara Naft close contact. Specializes in long ranged weapons. [[Estrid]] would consider her a friend. 
- Theodore Moyan runs this branch of the Knights. Hates [[Estrid]].
- located in a small, shabby, 3 story, concrete office building to conceal their true size and power. The exterior is stained with orange rust from the rainwater dripping off the metal roof and through leaky gutters. Like most buildings, there are thick metal grates over the small dusty windows hung with pale Venetian blinds. Heavy magical protections are set into the building. The front double doors are metal.
