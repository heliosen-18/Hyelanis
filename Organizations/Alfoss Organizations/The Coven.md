The Coven (witches) - Centennial Park

The covens are numerous. They serve many gods and goddesses and have little in common. A typical coven consists of a limited number of members, usually thirteen. Some covens are exclusively female, while others allow male members.

- [[Estrid]] has heard of them, but has never been inside, that she remembers, and she knows none of the members that she’s aware of.
