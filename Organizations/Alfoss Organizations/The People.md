The People (Necromancers) - The Sapphire Mirage Casino

Territory: Champion Heights, The Hive, Honeycomb Gap

The People defy categorization. Part cult, part corporation, part a scientific institution, the People concern themselves with necromancy: study, raising, and care of the undead. Like the Knights, the People have a national presence, with bases in most major cities. The People are obscenely wealthy and seemingly interested solely in increasing their wealth. They control the largest vampire stable (baby vampires that they have to train) on the continent and are not shy about wielding their influence. Unemotional and cold, they are the rivals of the Shapeshifters.
