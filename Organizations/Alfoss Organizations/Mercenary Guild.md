Mercenary Guild - MG Hall

Founded by Sheppard Red (just called Red)

The Mercenary Guild is a loosely structured organization which takes care of magic “hazmat” too minor to attract the attention of the [[Dawnwatch Knights]] or the local police force. They can also be hired as bodyguards and kidnapping cases.
- [[Estrid]] is familiar with this Guild. Has previously been a part of it and knows the players. Her friend Jenson occasionally takes jobs here

**The Mercenary Guild: Guardians of the Unseen**  
Within the intricate web of law and order that governs the bustling cities and remote villages of the realm, there exists a shadowy yet indispensable organization known as the Mercenary Guild. Far from the noble ideals of chivalry upheld by the [[Dawnwatch Knights]] or the strict enforcement of the law by local police forces, the Mercenary Guild operates in the murky realms where legality blurs and danger lurks in the shadows.
 
**Loose Structure, Bound by Necessity**  
The Mercenary Guild thrives on flexibility and adaptability, its structure more akin to a loose network of independent contractors rather than a rigid hierarchy. Mercenaries within the guild are bound together not by oaths of allegiance or codes of honor, but by mutual benefit and shared survival. They come from all walks of life – former soldiers, rogue mages, skilled artisans, and even desperate souls seeking a means to survive in a world wrought with peril.
 
**Handling Magical Hazmats**  
While the [[Dawnwatch Knights]] and local authorities focus on grander threats to public safety, the Mercenary Guild specializes in the mundane yet potentially catastrophic hazards that magic can unleash upon unsuspecting communities. From cursed artifacts and volatile alchemical concoctions to rogue spells gone awry, these "magic hazmats" pose a constant danger that requires swift and discreet intervention. The Mercenary Guild's operatives are adept at containment, neutralization, and disposal of these hazardous materials, ensuring that the general populace remains blissfully unaware of the arcane dangers lurking beneath the surface.
 
**The Silent Guardians: Bodyguards and Kidnapping Cases**  
Beyond their role as cleaners of magical messes, mercenaries of the guild are often sought after as silent guardians, hired to protect the lives and property of those who can afford their services. Whether it be wealthy merchants traversing dangerous roads, paranoid nobles fearing assassination attempts, or scholars delving into forbidden knowledge, the Mercenary Guild provides a discreet yet formidable shield against threats both mundane and supernatural.
 
Moreover, when loved ones vanish into the night or powerful individuals find themselves at the mercy of ruthless captors, it is often the Mercenary Guild that is called upon to navigate the treacherous underworld of kidnapping and ransom. Skilled in investigation, negotiation, and extraction, these mercenaries operate with a ruthless efficiency that sends shivers down the spines of those who would dare to defy their clients' wishes.
 
**The Ethical Quandary**  
Despite their indispensable role in maintaining the delicate balance of power and order, the Mercenary Guild's methods and motivations are often questioned and criticized. Some see them as little more than opportunistic mercenaries, willing to sell their swords to the highest bidder regardless of the morality of the cause. Others view them as necessary evils, a pragmatic solution to problems that fall through the cracks of traditional law enforcement and justice systems.
 
Yet, for those who find themselves in need of the Mercenary Guild's services, there are few alternatives. In a world where danger lurks around every corner and the forces of darkness threaten to breach the fragile veneer of civilization, the silent guardians of the Mercenary Guild stand ready to do what must be done – for a price.
