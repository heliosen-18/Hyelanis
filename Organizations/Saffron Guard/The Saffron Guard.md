*Background and Formation*
 
The Saffron Guard, a revered Romanesque military organization, finds its origin entwined with the construction and defense of [[The Moss Wall]], particularly at a strategic location known as Demon Watch. Established centuries ago, the Saffron Guard was created as a specialized force entrusted with the crucial task of guarding the main gate within [[The Moss Wall]], the portal between [[Bastion Reach]] and the perilous realm of The World Break.
 
*The Founding of Demon Watch*
 
Demon Watch, located at the main gate of [[The Moss Wall]], earned its name due to its role as the first line of defense against the malevolent forces from The World Break. As the Greenveil-covered barrier stood as a sentinel against interdimensional incursions, Demon Watch emerged as the primary bastion for this vital defense. The Romansque architecture of [[The Moss Wall]]'s main gate was designed not only for strength but also for its ornate and imposing appearance, reflecting the majesty of [[Bastion Reach]].
 
*Formation of the Saffron Guard*
 
As [[The Moss Wall]] was constructed and fortified, it became evident that a dedicated military force was required to protect the gate from both mundane threats and the infernal forces that might breach the Greenveil barrier. Thus, the Saffron Guard was born. The name "Saffron" was chosen for the vibrant saffron-colored uniforms worn by its members, which stood as a symbol of hope and courage amidst the darkness of The World Break.
 
*The Role and Responsibilities*
 
The Saffron Guard's primary responsibility was the defense of Demon Watch and the prevention of any unauthorized entry through the gate. Their duties included:
 
1. **Gatekeeper Guardians**: Members of the Saffron Guard were rigorously trained in the arts of combat, magic, and diplomacy. They acted as gatekeepers, responsible for ensuring that only those with proper authorization from the kingdom's authorities were allowed passage through [[The Moss Wall]].
 
2. **Emissaries and Negotiators**: In addition to their martial skills, some members of the Saffron Guard served as emissaries and negotiators with beings from The World Break who sought peaceful interaction with [[Bastion Reach]]. These diplomatic efforts aimed to establish and maintain a tenuous peace between the two realms.
 
3. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The Saffron Guard stationed at Demon Watch were tasked with monitoring the state of The World Break, watching for signs of increased demonic activity or any changes in the fissures. They would then report their findings to the kingdom's ruling council, ensuring that [[Bastion Reach]] remained prepared for any potential threats.
 
*Legacy and Ongoing Duties*
 
Over the centuries, the Saffron Guard has become an institution renowned for its unwavering dedication and vigilance. Their saffron-clad figures have become a symbol of security and protection in [[Bastion Reach]]. Despite periods of relative calm, the Saffron Guard's duties remain vital, for the veil between dimensions is a fragile one, and the forces of darkness are ever seeking to test its limits.
 
Demon Watch and the Saffron Guard are a testament to [[Bastion Reach]]'s commitment to safeguarding its realm from the malevolent forces of The World Break. They stand as a constant reminder that even in a world where magic and danger lurk in the shadows, the indomitable spirit of humanity perseveres, defending their kingdom against the most sinister of adversaries.
