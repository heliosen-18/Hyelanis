# **Purpose and Goals:**
The primary aim of the Shadowed Covenant is to tap into the potent and often perilous magic of the Feywild that lies beyond the conventional understanding of mortals and even many fey creatures. The organization believes that by embracing the shadows and harnessing the dark energies of their realm, they can gain power that transcends the limitations of both the Feywild and the mortal world.  

# **Structure:** 
The Covenant operates with a hierarchical structure, where each member is assigned a rank based on their mastery of dark magic and their loyalty to the organization. At the top sits [[The Gaunt Man]], acting as the secretive and enigmatic figurehead. Below him are various tiers of members, each specializing in different aspects of the Shadowed Covenant's practices:  
- **Whisperers:** These are the initiates of the Covenant, individuals who have proven their commitment and have shown potential in harnessing dark magic. They are taught the basic principles of shadow manipulation and the use of curses.  
- **Shadebinders:** More experienced members who have delved deeper into the shadow magic of the Feywild. Shadebinders specialize in controlling shadows and weaving curses that can manipulate the minds and fates of individuals.  
- **Eclipsarchs:** The elite spellcasters of the Covenant, Eclipsarchs have honed their mastery over the darkest aspects of the Feywild's magic. They can summon shadows, cast powerful hexes, and manipulate the boundaries between light and darkness.  
- **Shadowlords:** The inner circle of the Covenant, Shadowlords are trusted advisers to [[The Gaunt Man]]. They have glimpsed the true depths of the shadow magic and are tasked with overseeing the organization's most critical operations.  

# **Activities:**
The Covenant engages in a range of activities, from seeking hidden knowledge and artifacts to using shadow manipulation and curses to achieve their ends. Their operations might include:

- **Dark Bargains:** Members of the Covenant often strike deals with otherworldly entities, trading favors for power. These pacts can lead to moral ambiguity and internal conflicts within the organization.
- **Shadow Infiltration:** Covenant agents use their shadow manipulation to infiltrate organizations, cities, and courts, manipulating events from the shadows to further their goals.
- **Cursed Artifacts:** The Covenant collects and creates cursed artifacts that can bend the will of those who possess them. These items are used as tools of manipulation and coercion.
- **Forbidden Rites:** The Covenant practices rituals that tap into the Feywild's darkest magic, such as rituals to bind spirits or to amplify curses.


# **Interactions with Adventurers:**
Adventurers might come across the Shadowed Covenant when investigating strange occurrences or dark magic. They could be drawn into the organization's web through quests involving the retrieval of rare artifacts, the breaking of curses, or uncovering hidden knowledge. [[The Gaunt Man]] might offer cryptic guidance or present morally complex choices, forcing adventurers to navigate the thin line between wielding the power of shadows and succumbing to their dark allure. Encounters with the Covenant could challenge the adventurers' ethics and beliefs, as they confront the intricate balance between light and darkness within the Feywild.
