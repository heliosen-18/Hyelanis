SKYSHIPS STATISTICS
 
Skyships, like monsters and NPCs, have their own statistics. The statistics detailed below allow your skyships to adventure and enter combat. Furthermore, they grant your skyships unique characteristics that help set them apart from other skyships.
 
COMMON SHIP TYPES
 
Within [[Hyelanis]] there are three basic ship types that are commonly found, but many more exist within these umbrellas. These three ship types are drastically different from one another and used by entirely different classes of people for entirely different reasons. Most navies employ a large number of shard blimps as their main core and supplement soralite ships in for powerful auxiliaries and scout ships. The rich moguls almost never own anything other than luxury soralite yachts and well-off city-dwellers usually only own skyskiffs for personal transportation purposes.
 
**Soralites**
 
Soralites are the most technologically advanced ships. They populate the skies with a dim glowing blue. These ships are powered by a large sordalite crystal attached to the hull of the ship, providing it with flight and power. To integrate a crystal in this fashion takes a lot of skill and expertise. As such, these ships are typically the most expensive of all the ships in [[Hyelanis]]. There are exceptions to this, but due to the sheer size of the crystal required and the expertise needed for a full systems integration, the cost is usually quite high.
 
**Shard Blimps**
 
Shard blimps are easily the most common ships in [[Hyelanis]]. There are fewer overall classes of shard blimps when compared to the more powerful soralite ships, but they are far more plentiful as most passenger and merchant ships are shard blimps. They each have a shard furnace below deck and a Featherhatch Canvas envelope above it. These ships make use of relatively small shards of sordalite magically burning inside the shard furance and filling the envelope with magical vapors, giving the ship its power of flight. Due to the cost-saving nature of these ships, they are usually much slower and less well armed than soralite ships. They often do not have the power to equip spell cannons or spell jet thrusters.
 
**Skyskiffs**
 
Skyskiff is a very broad term for any type of aircraft that is too small to voyage great distances on. These skyskiffs are typically operated within cities as personal craft, taxis, or even racing vessels.  
They are powered by much smaller sordalite crystals than the soralite ships, often mounted on the hull or inside an internal generator located in the hull. These ships don’t rely on the sheer size of their crystals for their flight or power and have to be magically enhanced in order to make them fly. All of the ship’s power is used for flight and propulsion; if the ship has weaponry it must be equipped with a secondary weapon crystal.
