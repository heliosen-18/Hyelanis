Sordalite is an uncommonly light precious gem. In its natural state it is sky blue, nearly translucent. When imbucd with different types of magic, it can sometimes change its color. The color of these changed crystals most often reflects the elemental power or focus of the spell that imbucd it. For example, nccrotic magic imbucd upon a sordalite crystal results in carcassite, a purple-hued crystal. Sordalite crystals, while not uncommon, are not cheap.
 
PROPERTIES OF SORDALITE   Sordalite is a unique material that exists in a hardened crystal form. It is shaped, mined, and used like any other precious gem, but has several properties that set it apart.  
**Natural Levitation**. Sordalite has the inherent ability to levitate. A free piece of sordalite will hover several feet off of the ground. One pound of sordalite has the ability to levitate up to 100 pounds. **Weight**. Sordalite is extremely lightweight. One cubic foot of refined sordalite weighs 1 pound.  
**Spell Component.** Due to Sordalite's natural magical energy, it can be used as a spell focus for any caster. It can also be used to replace costly spell components for certain spell of equivalent value. However, if the spell consumes this this costly spell component then an equivalent amount of the Sordalite is also consumed.

REFINING SORDALITE
 
Unrefined sordalite yields half its weight in refined sordalite. For example, 1 pound of unrefined sordalite would be refined down to ½ pound of refined sordalite. Refining sordalite costs 20% of its current value; for example, 100 pounds of unrefined sordalite would cost 10,000 gp to refine. After it is refined, it is worth more. This is reflected in the table below.
