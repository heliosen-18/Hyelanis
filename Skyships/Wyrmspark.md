**Description:**  
Wyrmspark is a magically infused alchemical substance used to propel projectiles from cannons and other siege weaponry. It is a highly volatile powder that ignites upon high-velocity impact, releasing a powerful burst of energy. Wyrmspark is primarily produced in 
[[Finehold]], where skilled alchemists combine ground sulfur, bat guano, and a trace amount of [[Sordalite Crystals|Sordalite Crystal]] dust to create this potent explosive. Due to its volatile nature, Wyrmspark must be handled with care and transported according to strict regulations.
 
Wyrmspark is a very fine powder, similar in texture to beach sand. It has an overall light brown or beige color with flecks of orange particles, likely due to the presence of Sordalite.![[Wyrmspark.jpg]]
