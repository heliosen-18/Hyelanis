The skyships in [[Hyelanis]] are powered through magic known as spelldriving: those who employ this magic are called spelldrivers. Like any arcane path, anyone can learn to be a spelldriver, but very few have the ability to master its techniques.
 
SPELLDRIVING PROFICIENCY
 
To become a spelldriver, a character must be proficient with a new tool proficiency called spelldriving. In order to become proficient in spelldriving, the character must have the ability to cast at least one 1st-level spell. Characters can take the proficiency as part of character creation, replacing any tool proficiencies made available through their racial, class, or background features, or gain proficiency through use and training.
 
THE ART OF SPELLDRIVING
 
When a character becomes proficient in spelldriving, they can exchange the magical energy that they use to fuel their spells to create spelldriving points, which allows them to control the ships and create a variety of special effects via Spelldriving Modes.
 
SPELLDRIVING ABILITY
 
A spelldriver uses the same ability for spelldriving that they do for their magical abilities. For example, wizards use Intelligence as their spelldriving ability, clerics use Wisdom as their spelldriving ability, and so on. Spelldrivers do not need a focus to use spelldriving abilities.
 
SPELLDRIVING POINTS
 
As a bonus action on the character's turn, they can expend one spell slot, or expend a single use of a spell if the spell is gained through a racial feature or feat, and gain a number of spelldriving points equal to the slot or spell's base level to their spelldriving point bank. Note that expending spells in this way does not create the normal effects for the spell.  
A spelldriver may have as many spelldriving points in their spelldriving point bank as determined by their character level. See "Spelldriving Point Bank Maximums." A character's spelldriving point bank is emptied, and all unused spelldriving points discarded, at the end of a long rest.  
For example, a character who can normally cast faerie fire, a lst-level spell, through one of their racial traits can expend the spell to convert it into spelldriving point. And if that character expended darkness to convert it to spelldriving points, they would gain 2 spelldriving points. As normal, the spelldriver regains use of those spell slots when they complete a long rest.

SPELLDRIVING MODES
 
Characters proficient in spelldriving can use their spelldriving points to drive, control, or defend the skyships via special effects known as spelldriving modes.  
As long as you are proficient in spelldriving, you know all the modes available for the specific skyships you are on and do not need to learn or prepare new modes. As long as you have the required number of spelldriving points in your spelldriving point bank, you may use any spelldriving mode.  
A ship cannot gain the benefits from two or more instances of the same spelldriving mode.  
Spelldriving modes count as spells for the purposes of function. For example, they can be counterspelled. The spelldriving mode's level is determined by multiplying the number of spelldriving points used to activate the mode by 2 for the purposes of counterspells.
 
The most common mode is called _Momentum:_
 
MOMENTUM 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Cost: 1 spelldriving point 
Duration: 24 hours
This mode grants the spelldriver control over the skyship's helm. The spelldriver can make the ship start and stop as well as move it in any direction the ship could naturally move. When the spelldriver controls the ship, it is unusable by normal means; but the spelldriver can give control back to the crew during the mode's duration in order to focus on other tasks. The spelldriver can resume control at any time until the mode ends.
